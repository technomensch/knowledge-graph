# Knowledge Graph Plugin

**Structured knowledge capture, lesson-learned documentation, and cross-session memory for Claude Code projects.**

The Knowledge Graph Plugin captures institutional knowledge — lessons learned, architecture decisions, and recurring patterns — directly inside the development workflow. Claude Code users get 22 slash commands. MCP IDE users get 7 tools. Any platform gets the template system.
