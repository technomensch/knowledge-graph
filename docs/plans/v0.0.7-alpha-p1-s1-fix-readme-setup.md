# Session 1: Rename SETUP.md + Fix References

**Branch**: `v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s1`
**Phase**: 1 (Critical UX Fixes)
**Session**: 1 of 9
**Model**: Sonnet 4.5
**Estimated Time**: 0.5-1 hour
**Estimated Tokens**: ~20K
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started
**Parallelizable**: ❌ No (foundational rename that other sessions depend on)

---

## Prerequisites

### Git State
- [ ] Currently on branch: `v0.0.7-alpha-gitbook-docs`
- [ ] Working directory is clean (no uncommitted changes)
- [ ] Latest changes from remote pulled
- [ ] No previous session to merge

### Verification Commands
```bash
git status  # Should show "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
git branch --show-current  # Should show "v0.0.7-alpha-gitbook-docs"
git pull origin v0.0.7-alpha-gitbook-docs  # Ensure up to date
```

## Session Goals

**Primary Objective**: Rename `docs/SETUP.md` to `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`, remove its installation content, refocus it on post-install configuration, and update all references across the project.

**What We're Fixing**:
- `SETUP.md` mixes installation steps with configuration, creating confusion
- The name "SETUP" is ambiguous (install? configure? both?)
- References to SETUP.md are scattered across multiple files

**What We're NOT Doing** (deferred to Session 7):
- ❌ Consolidating installation into README.md
- ❌ Adding a "First 5 Minutes" quick start guide to README
- ❌ Creating GETTING-STARTED.md
- ❌ Restructuring README.md's installation section

**Why this separation matters**: Session 7 creates `GETTING-STARTED.md` as the canonical installation source and restructures README.md. If we add installation content to README now, Session 7 would need to undo that work. This session focuses narrowly on the rename and content refocus.

**Impact**: Removes the confusing "SETUP.md" name and eliminates one source of contradictory installation guidance.

---

## Files to Modify

### Primary Files (Rename/Modify)
1. **docs/SETUP.md** → **docs/CONFIGURATION.md** (rename)
   - Remove installation content (lines 10-31)
   - Refocus on: post-install configuration, sanitization, team workflows
   - Update internal links

### Files to Update References In
2. **README.md** - Update any links from SETUP.md to CONFIGURATION.md
3. **core/README.md** - Update references
4. **core/docs/PLATFORM-ADAPTATION.md** - Update references
5. **Any other files** referencing SETUP.md (found via grep)

### Files to Read First
- `docs/SETUP.md` (understand current content and what's installation vs configuration)
- `README.md` (find SETUP.md references)
- `core/README.md` (find SETUP.md references)

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Branch
```bash
git checkout -b v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s1
```

### Step 2: Analyze SETUP.md Content
- [ ] Read all of docs/SETUP.md
- [ ] Identify which lines are installation instructions (to remove)
- [ ] Identify which lines are configuration instructions (to keep)
- [ ] Note any content that is unique to SETUP.md (not duplicated elsewhere)

### Step 3: Rename and Refocus
- [ ] Rename `docs/SETUP.md` to `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` using `git mv`
- [ ] Remove installation-related content (lines that duplicate README.md or will be covered by GETTING-STARTED.md in Session 7)
- [ ] Update the title/header to reflect the new focus: "Configuration Guide"
- [ ] Ensure remaining content focuses on: sanitization setup, team workflows, advanced configuration, multi-KG configuration

### Step 4: Update All References
- [ ] Find all references: `grep -r "SETUP" --include="*.md" .`
- [ ] Update each reference from SETUP.md to CONFIGURATION.md
- [ ] Update link text where appropriate (e.g., "Setup Guide" → "Configuration Guide")
- [ ] Check `core/docs/PLATFORM-ADAPTATION.md` specifically

### Step 5: Simplify Jargon in CONFIGURATION.md
While editing, improve language clarity in the remaining content:
- "From Source" → "Development version"
- "npm install -g" → "Install globally with npm (Node.js package manager)"

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Rename Complete
- [ ] `docs/SETUP.md` no longer exists
- [ ] `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` exists with configuration-focused content
- [ ] No installation instructions remain in CONFIGURATION.md
- [ ] No references to "SETUP.md" remain anywhere in the project

### Content Quality
- [ ] CONFIGURATION.md has a clear, focused scope (post-install configuration only)
- [ ] No orphaned content (nothing valuable was deleted without being preserved elsewhere)
- [ ] Language is beginner-friendly where possible

### Git Hygiene
- [ ] Used `git mv` for the rename (preserves git history)
- [ ] Commits are atomic
- [ ] No unrelated changes included

---

## Definition of Done

### Code Changes
- [ ] docs/SETUP.md renamed to docs/CONFIGURATION.md via `git mv`
- [ ] Installation content removed from CONFIGURATION.md
- [ ] All cross-references updated project-wide

### Quality Checks
- [ ] `grep -r "SETUP" --include="*.md" .` returns no results (except CHANGELOG/ROADMAP historical references, which are acceptable)
- [ ] `npx markdown-link-check docs/CONFIGURATION.md` passes
- [ ] `npx markdown-link-check README.md` passes

### Git Workflow
- [ ] All changes committed with clear messages
- [ ] Branch pushed to remote: `git push -u origin v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s1`
- [ ] No merge conflicts with base branch

---

## Verification Commands

### Before Starting
```bash
git status
git checkout -b v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s1
git branch --show-current  # Should show v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s1
```

### During Work
```bash
# Find all SETUP.md references
grep -r "SETUP" --include="*.md" .

# Rename with git history preservation
git mv docs/SETUP.md docs/CONFIGURATION.md
```

### Before Committing
```bash
git diff
git add docs/CONFIGURATION.md README.md core/README.md core/docs/PLATFORM-ADAPTATION.md

git commit -m "docs: rename SETUP.md to CONFIGURATION.md, refocus on post-install config

- Renamed docs/SETUP.md -> docs/CONFIGURATION.md (preserves git history)
- Removed installation content (deferred to GETTING-STARTED.md in Session 7)
- Refocused on post-install configuration, sanitization, team workflows
- Updated all cross-references project-wide
- Preparation for installation consolidation in Session 7

git push -u origin v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s1
```

### After Completion
```bash
git checkout v0.0.7-alpha-gitbook-docs
git merge v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s1
git push origin v0.0.7-alpha-gitbook-docs
```

---

## Next Session

**After this session completes**:
- [ ] Merge v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s1 back to base
- [ ] Verify merge succeeded
- [ ] Sessions 2 and 3 can proceed in parallel (see Parallelization Guide)
- [ ] Branch names: `v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s2` and `v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s3`

---

## Notes

**Why rename instead of delete?**
- SETUP.md has valuable configuration content (sanitization, team workflows)
- "CONFIGURATION" is a clearer name for this content
- `git mv` preserves history

**Scope boundary**:
- This session does NOT add a "First 5 Minutes" guide (Session 7 handles that)
- This session does NOT restructure README.md's installation section (Session 7 handles that)
- This session ONLY renames, refocuses, and fixes references

**Time Estimate Breakdown**:
- Read/analyze SETUP.md content: 10-15 min
- Rename and refocus content: 15-20 min
- Update cross-references: 15-20 min
- Quality checks: 5-10 min
- **Total**: 45-65 minutes (0.5-1 hour)
