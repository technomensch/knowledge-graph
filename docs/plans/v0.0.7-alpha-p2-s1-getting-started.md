# Session 7 (Phase 2): Create GETTING-STARTED.md

**Branch**: `v0.0.7-alpha-p2-s1`
**Phase**: 2 (Consolidation & Navigation)
**Session**: 7 of 9
**Model**: Sonnet 4.5
**Estimated Time**: 2-2.5 hours
**Estimated Tokens**: ~35K
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started
**Parallelizable**: ❌ No (builds on Phase 1 content)

---

## Prerequisites

### Phase 1 Complete
- [ ] ✅ Phase 1 (Sessions 1-6) completed and merged
- [ ] ✅ User reviewed Phase 1 improvements
- [ ] ✅ User approved proceeding to Phase 2

### Git State
- [ ] Currently on branch: `v0.0.7-alpha-gitbook-docs`
- [ ] Working directory is clean
- [ ] All Phase 1 changes merged and pushed

### Verification Commands
```bash
git checkout v0.0.7-alpha-gitbook-docs
git pull origin v0.0.7-alpha-gitbook-docs
git status
git log --oneline -15  # Should see all Phase 1 sessions
```

---

## Session Goals

**Primary Objective**: Create user type routing flowchart, consolidate installation guidance, and establish GETTING-STARTED.md as the canonical installation source

**What We're Creating**:
- `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md` - Single entry point for all user types
- User type flowchart: Claude vs non-Claude, technical vs non-technical
- Platform-specific installation paths
- "First 5 Minutes" quick wins for each user type

**What We're Also Doing** (absorbed from Session 1's original scope):
- Consolidating README.md's installation section to link to GETTING-STARTED.md instead of containing full instructions
- Removing installation duplication from core/README.md
- Establishing GETTING-STARTED.md as the single source of truth for installation

**Impact**: Resolves the remaining installation duplication. After Session 1 renamed SETUP.md → CONFIGURATION.md, this session completes the consolidation by creating the canonical installation document.

---

## Files to Modify

### Primary Files (Create)
1. **docs/GETTING-STARTED.md** (new file, ~400-500 lines)
   - User type routing
   - Installation by platform
   - Quick start guides
   - Next steps by user type

### Primary Files (Modify)
2. **README.md**
   - Remove installation details
   - Link to GETTING-STARTED.md
   - Keep high-level overview only

3. **core/README.md**
   - Remove installation duplication
   - Link to GETTING-STARTED.md

### Files to Read First
- Current README.md (installation section)
- docs/CONFIGURATION.md (renamed from SETUP.md in Session 1)
- core/README.md
- core/docs/PLATFORM-ADAPTATION.md

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Branch
```bash
git checkout -b v0.0.7-alpha-p2-s1
```

### Step 2: Design User Type Flowchart

**Five user types identified**:

1. **Claude Code user, beginner** (25%)
   - Path: Install plugin → `/knowledge:init` → capture first lesson
   - Time to first success: <5 min

2. **Claude Code user, experienced** (20%)
   - Path: Advanced workflows, team setup
   - Time: <10 min to full setup

3. **Non-Claude AI user** (Continue, Cursor, Aider) (30%)
   - Path: Manual setup → platform integration → first entry
   - Time: <10 min

4. **No AI assistant, technical** (15%)
   - Path: Manual workflows → shell aliases → first entry
   - Time: <15 min

5. **No AI assistant, non-technical** (10%)
   - Path: Manual workflows → GUI tools → first entry
   - Time: <20 min

### Step 3: Create docs/GETTING-STARTED.md

**Structure**:
```markdown
# Getting Started with Knowledge Graph

**Welcome!** This guide gets you from zero to your first captured lesson in 5-20 minutes (depending on your setup).

## Claude Code Quick Start

**Prerequisites**:
- Claude Code plugin installed ([get it here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/...))
- Git installed (optional but recommended)

**Steps**:

1. **Initialize knowledge graph** (30 seconds)
   ```bash
   /knowledge:init
   ```
   Claude will ask:
   - Project name? (use your current project name)
   - Enable git tracking? (recommended: yes)

2. **Verify setup** (10 seconds)
   ```bash
   /knowledge:status
   ```
   Should show: "Knowledge Graph: [your-project], 0 lessons"

3. **Capture your first lesson** (3-4 minutes)
   ```bash
   /knowledge:capture-lesson
   ```
   Think of a recent problem you solved. Claude will guide you through documenting it.

4. **Verify it worked** (10 seconds)
   ```bash
   /knowledge:status
   ```
   Should show: "1 lesson"

**Done!** You've captured your first lesson.

**Next steps**:
- Read [Essential Commands](COMMAND-GUIDE.md#essential-commands)
- Browse [examples](../core/examples/) to see what's possible
- Set up [sanitization](CONFIGURATION.md#sanitization) before sharing code

## AI Assistant Setup

**Prerequisites**:
- AI assistant installed (Cursor, Continue, Aider, etc.)
- Git installed (recommended)
- Terminal access

**Steps**:

1. **Install core system** (2 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Clone or download the core system
   cd your-project
   mkdir -p docs

   # Copy core templates and scripts
   cp -r /path/to/knowledge-graph/core docs/kg-core
   ```

2. **Set up directory structure** (1 minute)
   ```bash
   cd docs
   mkdir -p lessons-learned decisions knowledge sessions
   cp -r kg-core/templates/. templates/
   ```

3. **Configure your AI assistant** (2 minutes)

   Add this to your AI assistant's instructions:
   ```
   When the user asks to document a lesson:
   1. Copy docs/templates/lessons-learned/lesson-template.md
   2. Fill in [MANUAL] fields based on conversation
   3. Save to docs/lessons-learned/[category]/[Title].md
   4. Leave [AUTO] fields for user to fill
   ```

4. **Create your first lesson** (5 minutes)

   Ask your AI assistant:
   "Help me document a lesson I just learned about [your topic]"

**Next steps**:
- Read [Manual Workflows](../core/docs/WORKFLOWS.md)
- See [Platform Adaptation](../core/docs/PLATFORM-ADAPTATION.md) for your specific AI
- Review [Pattern Writing Guide](../core/docs/PATTERNS-GUIDE.md)

---

## Manual Setup

**Prerequisites**:
- Git installed (optional)
- Text editor (vim, VSCode, etc.)

**Steps**:

1. **Download templates** (1 minute)
   ```bash
   # Clone the core system (or download from GitHub releases)
   git clone https://github.com/technomensch/knowledge-graph.git /tmp/kg-source

   # Copy just the core system to your project
   cp -r /tmp/kg-source/core your-project/docs/kg-core
   ```

2. **Create directory structure** (1 minute)
   ```bash
   mkdir -p lessons-learned/{architecture,process,patterns,debugging}
   mkdir -p decisions knowledge sessions
   ```

3. **Create your first lesson** (10 minutes)

   **Copy template**:
   ```bash
   cp templates/lessons-learned/lesson-template.md \
      lessons-learned/debugging/My_First_Lesson.md
   ```

   **Open in editor**:
   ```bash
   vim lessons-learned/debugging/My_First_Lesson.md
   ```

   **Fill in [MANUAL] fields** (see field markers in template):
   - `title`: "Lesson: [What you learned]"
   - `category`: Pick one (architecture/process/patterns/debugging)
   - `tags`: [relevant, keywords]

   **Write content** in the body sections:
   - What was the problem?
   - What was the root cause?
   - How did you solve it?
   - How to prevent it?

4. **Save and commit** (if using git)
   ```bash
   git add lessons-learned/debugging/My_First_Lesson.md
   git commit -m "docs: add first lesson"
   ```

**Next steps**:
- Read [Manual Workflows](../core/docs/WORKFLOWS.md) for detailed guides
- Set up [shell aliases](../core/docs/WORKFLOWS.md#shell-aliases) for faster workflows
- Review [examples](../core/examples/) for inspiration

## Conceptual Overview

**What is this?**

A knowledge graph is a structured way to capture and organize what you learn while working.

**Why use it?**

- **Remember solutions**: Solved a tricky bug? Document it. Next time (or when a teammate hits it), search and find the fix in 30 seconds.
- **Share knowledge**: New team member? Point them to your lessons. They get months of context in hours.
- **Learn patterns**: After 10 database lessons, patterns emerge. The system extracts them automatically.
- **Feed your AI**: Best lessons sync to your AI assistant's memory, so it "remembers" your patterns.

**How does it work?**

1. **Capture** lessons as you solve problems
2. **Organize** into categories (architecture, debugging, etc.)
3. **Search** when you need to recall something
4. **Sync** patterns to AI memory (optional)

**What makes it a "graph"?**

- Lessons link to decisions ("Why we chose X")
- Decisions link to knowledge ("How X works")
- Git metadata links to code ("Where we implemented X")
- Everything searchable, everything connected

**Is this just fancy note-taking?**

Kind of! But with structure that enables:
- ✅ Fast search (find lessons by date, tag, category)
- ✅ Consistency (templates ensure nothing missed)
- ✅ Automation (AI can read and write entries)
- ✅ Team sharing (sanitization built-in)

## Troubleshooting

### "I installed but commands don't work"
- **For Claude Code**: Restart Claude Code, verify plugin installed
- **For other AI**: Check AI instructions include template paths

### "Which category should I use?"
- **architecture**: System design, how components fit together
- **process**: Workflow improvements, tools, procedures
- **patterns**: Reusable solutions, best practices
- **debugging**: Bug fixes, troubleshooting

### "Do I need git?"
- **Recommended** but not required
- With git: Auto-tracks branch/commit/PR metadata
- Without git: Still works, just no automatic linking to code

---

### Step 4: Update README.md

Remove installation details, keep high-level:
```markdown
## Quick Start

Choose your setup path:
- **Claude Code users**: [5-minute setup](docs/GETTING-STARTED.md#claude-code-quick-start)
- **Other AI assistants**: [10-minute setup](docs/GETTING-STARTED.md#ai-assistant-setup)
- **Manual workflows**: [15-minute setup](docs/GETTING-STARTED.md#manual-setup)

See [Getting Started Guide](docs/GETTING-STARTED.md) for detailed instructions.
```

### Step 5: Update core/README.md

Remove duplication:
```markdown
## Installation

See the main [Getting Started Guide](../../docs/GETTING-STARTED.md) for installation instructions.

This directory (`core/`) contains the platform-agnostic knowledge graph system.
```
