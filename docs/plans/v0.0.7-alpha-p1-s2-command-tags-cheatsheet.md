## Session Goals

**Primary Objective**: Add command difficulty tags and create quick reference cheat sheet

**What We're Adding**:
- Command difficulty classifications (Essential/Intermediate/Advanced)
- Quick reference guide mapping tasks → commands
- Key concepts glossary for common terms

**Impact**: Users currently discover ~5 of 19 commands. This creates a learning path to discover all commands progressively.

**CHEAT-SHEET.md vs COMMAND-GUIDE.md** (created in Session 5):
- **CHEAT-SHEET.md** (this session): Single-page quick reference. No explanations, just task→command mappings. Think "card taped to your monitor." Should fit on one printed page (~200 lines).
- **COMMAND-GUIDE.md** (Session 5): Comprehensive reference with full documentation per command (purpose, when to use, what it does, examples, learning path, troubleshooting). Think "textbook chapter" (~500-600 lines).
- Keep CHEAT-SHEET.md intentionally brief. Link to COMMAND-GUIDE.md for details.

## Files to Modify

### Primary Files (Create)
1. **docs/CHEAT-SHEET.md** (new file, ~200 lines)
   - Common tasks → command mapping
   - Quick reference table
   - Key concepts glossary

### Primary Files (Modify)
2. **README.md**
   - Add difficulty tags to command list
   - Link to CHEAT-SHEET.md
   - Add "Essential Commands" section

### Files to Read First
- `/Users/mkaplan/Documents/GitHub/knowledge-graph/README.md` (command list section)
- `/Users/mkaplan/Documents/GitHub/knowledge-graph/commands/` (review all 19 commands)

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Branch
```bash
git checkout -b v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s2
```

### Step 2: Classify Commands by Difficulty
Review all 19 commands and classify:

**Essential** (First-time users, 4 commands):
- [ ] `/knowledge:init` - Initialize knowledge graph
- [ ] `/knowledge:capture-lesson` - Document lessons learned
- [ ] `/knowledge:status` - View KG status
- [ ] `/knowledge:recall` - Search knowledge

**Intermediate** (Active users, 8 commands):
- [ ] `/knowledge:update-graph` - Sync lessons to KG
- [ ] `/knowledge:add-category` - Add custom category
- [ ] `/knowledge:session-summary` - Summarize chat session
- [ ] `/knowledge:list` - List all knowledge graphs
- [ ] `/knowledge:switch` - Change active KG
- [ ] `/knowledge:check-sensitive` - Scan for sensitive data
- [ ] `/knowledge:config-sanitization` - Set up pre-commit hooks
- [ ] `/knowledge:extract-chat` - Extract chat history

**Advanced** (Power users, 7 commands):
- [ ] `/knowledge:meta-issue` - Track complex problems
- [ ] `/knowledge:start-issue-tracking` - Initialize issue tracking
- [ ] `/knowledge:update-issue-plan` - Sync with GitHub issues
- [ ] `/knowledge:link-issue` - Link lessons to GitHub
- [ ] `/knowledge:archive-memory` - Archive MEMORY.md entries
- [ ] `/knowledge:restore-memory` - Restore archived memories
- [ ] `/knowledge:sync-all` - Full 4-step sync pipeline

### Step 3: Update README.md Command List
- [ ] Add difficulty badges to each command
- [ ] Format: `🟢 Essential` `🟡 Intermediate` `🔴 Advanced`
- [ ] Group commands by difficulty in README
- [ ] Add "Start Here" section pointing to Essential commands

### Step 4: Create docs/CHEAT-SHEET.md

**Structure**:
```markdown
# Knowledge Graph Quick Reference

## I Want To...

- **Start a new knowledge graph** → `/knowledge:init`
- **Document what I just learned** → `/knowledge:capture-lesson`
- **Find something I documented before** → `/knowledge:recall "search query"`
- **See what's in my knowledge graph** → `/knowledge:status`
- **Set up team knowledge sharing** → `/knowledge:config-sanitization`
- **Track a complex bug** → `/knowledge:meta-issue`

## Commands by Difficulty

### 🟢 Essential (Start Here)
[Table with 4 essential commands]

### 🟡 Intermediate (Once Comfortable)
[Table with 8 intermediate commands]

### 🔴 Advanced (Power Features)
[Table with 7 advanced commands]

## Key Concepts

- **Knowledge Graph**: Structured collection of lessons, decisions, patterns
- **YAML Frontmatter**: Metadata at top of files (title, date, tags, etc.)
- **Git Metadata**: Automatic tracking of branch, commit, PR, issue
- **MEMORY.md**: Persistent context file synced to Claude's prompt
- **Sanitization**: Removing sensitive data before sharing
- **Meta-Issue**: Multi-attempt problem tracking system

## Common Workflows

### First Time Setup (5 minutes)
1. `/knowledge:init`
2. `/knowledge:capture-lesson` (document your first learning)
3. `/knowledge:status` (verify it worked)

### Daily Use (10 minutes)
1. Solve problem or learn something
2. `/knowledge:capture-lesson` (document it)
3. `/knowledge:update-graph` (sync to KG)

### Before Sharing Code (2 minutes)
1. `/knowledge:check-sensitive` (scan for secrets)
2. Review findings
3. Remove sensitive data before git push

## Quick Tips

- Start with Essential commands, add others as needed
- Use `/knowledge:status` to see what's in your KG
- `/knowledge:recall` searches everything (lessons, decisions, knowledge)
- MEMORY.md auto-updates - check it before important sessions
```

### Step 5: Add Cross-References
- [ ] Link from README.md to CHEAT-SHEET.md
- [ ] Add "See Also: Quick Reference" to command sections
- [ ] Link from docs/CONFIGURATION.md to CHEAT-SHEET.md

## Notes

**Command Classification Rationale**:
- **Essential**: Commands needed for first 30 days of usage
- **Intermediate**: Commands for regular ongoing use
- **Advanced**: Commands for complex workflows, team setups, power users

**User Testing**:
- After this session, ask beginner: "Can you find the command to search your knowledge?"
- Success: They navigate README → Essential Commands → `/knowledge:recall`
- Time to find: Should be <30 seconds

**Time Estimate Breakdown**:
- Review and classify 19 commands: 15-20 min
- Update README.md command list: 15-20 min
- Create CHEAT-SHEET.md: 30-40 min
- Add cross-references: 10 min
- Quality checks: 10 min
- **Total**: 60-90 minutes (1-1.5 hours)
