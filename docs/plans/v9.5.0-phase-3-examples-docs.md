# v9.5.0 Phase 3: Examples + Documentation

**Session:** 2 — Opus in Antigravity (parallel with Phase 2 in Claude Code)
**Goal:** Generalize ~30 example files + write all 10 documentation files.
**Deliverable:** Complete example library and docs, ready to drop into plugin directory.
**Depends on:** Phase 1 (need skill names + architecture — all defined in master plan)
**Runs in parallel with:** Phase 2 (Claude Code) and optionally Phase 4
**Reference:** See `v9.5.0-master-plan.md` for skill specs, example library details, and terminology generalization rules.

## Why This Phase Runs in Antigravity

This is pure markdown writing — read existing files, generalize content, write new documentation. No file system operations or code execution needed. The Antigravity agent receives:
1. This plan file
2. The master plan (`v9.5.0-master-plan.md`)
3. Source files to generalize (pasted into the conversation)

Output: Markdown content for each file, which gets copy-pasted into the plugin directory in Claude Code.

## 3.1: Copy and generalize examples (~30 files)

**Source files** (provide these to the Antigravity agent):

| Source in optimize-my-resume | Target in plugin | Generalization Level |
|------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| `docs/knowledge/patterns.md` (select 12 entries) | `core/examples/knowledge/sample-patterns.md` | Medium — replace project refs |
| `docs/knowledge/concepts.md` (select 6 entries) | `core/examples/knowledge/sample-concepts.md` | Medium |
| `docs/knowledge/gotchas.md` (select 6 entries) | `core/examples/knowledge/sample-gotchas.md` | Medium |
| `docs/lessons-learned/architecture/*.md` (select 2) | `core/examples/lessons-learned/architecture/` | Medium-High |
| `docs/lessons-learned/process/*.md` (select 4) | `core/examples/lessons-learned/process/` | Medium |
| `docs/lessons-learned/patterns/*.md` (select 1) | `core/examples/lessons-learned/patterns/` | Low |
| `docs/decisions/ADR-001.md` | `core/examples/decisions/ADR-001-example.md` | Low |
| `docs/decisions/ADR-011.md` | `core/examples/decisions/ADR-002-example.md` | None |
| `docs/issues/v9.3.x-enforcement-saga/` | `core/examples/meta-issue/example-performance-saga/` | High |

### Generalization rules for ALL examples:

1. Add `<!-- THIS IS AN EXAMPLE — Replace with your project's patterns -->` header
2. Find/replace terminology:
   - `resume optimization` → `output optimization`
   - `enforcement` → `compliance`
   - `v9.3.x` → `v2.x` or `phase 2`
   - `Shadow Sync Protocol` → `Multi-Tier Synchronization Pattern`
   - `PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` → `PROJECT-CONFIG.md`
   - `/gov-git-branch` → `/governance:validate-branch`
   - `optimization-tools/` → `config-modules/`
3. Replace specific names with roles: "John Smith" → "Backend Developer"
4. Replace project-specific skill names with generic equivalents
5. Verify no broken internal cross-references
6. Keep structural patterns (Problem → Root Cause → Solution → Replication → Lessons)
7. Keep cross-reference patterns (link to KG entry, link to ADR, link to lesson)
8. Keep actionable "When to use" triggers
9. Preserve the LEVERAGE principle: KG = quick ref, Lesson = deep dive

### Specific example files to create:

**Knowledge Graph examples (3 files):**
