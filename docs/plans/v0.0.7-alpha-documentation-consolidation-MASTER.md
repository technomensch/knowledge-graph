# Documentation Consolidation - Scenario A Master Plan

**Version**: v0.0.7-alpha
**Type**: Documentation Consolidation
**Estimated Total Time**: 15-17.5 hours sequential, 11.5-15 hours with parallelization (user work: 2-3 hours)
**Total Sessions**: 9 sessions across 4 days (with parallelization)
**Total Token Budget**: ~310K tokens

---

## Overview

This master plan coordinates the consolidation of knowledge graph plugin documentation to improve user-friendliness. Work is split into 2 phases across 9 sessions.

**What We're Fixing**:
- ❌ Contradictory installation instructions (README vs SETUP)
- ❌ No entry point for different user types
- ❌ Templates unclear (which fields are auto vs manual)
- ❌ WORKFLOWS.md too technical (843 lines with jargon)
- ❌ Missing glossary for key terms
- ❌ No command learning path

**What We're NOT Changing**:
- ✅ `/commands/*.md` files (LLM prompts, not user docs)
- ✅ `core/examples/` (immutable sanitized examples)
- ✅ `docs/` directory (developer KG, excluded from distribution)

---

## Phase 1: Critical UX Fixes (6 sessions, 9-10.5 hours)

**Goal**: Reduce time-to-first-success from 15-25 minutes to <10 minutes
**Measurable Targets**:
- Time-to-first-lesson: <10 minutes for Claude Code users, <15 minutes for manual users
- Navigation depth: Any doc reachable from README in <=3 clicks
- Jargon density: Zero undefined technical terms in user-facing docs

**Phase 1 Totals**: 9-10.5 hours, ~205K tokens

---

## Phase 2: Consolidation & Navigation (3 sessions, 6-7 hours)

**Goal**: Establish single source of truth, improve discoverability
**Measurable Targets**:
- Single source of truth: No duplicated installation/setup instructions
- Cross-reference coverage: All docs have "See Also" sections with bidirectional links
- User journey completion: All 5 user types can complete setup end-to-end

### Sessions

| Session | Branch | Model | Time | Tokens | Status |
|---------|--------|-------|------|--------|--------|
| 7 | v0.0.7-alpha-p2-s1 | Sonnet 4.5 | 2-2.5h | ~35K | ⬜ Not Started |
| 8 | v0.0.7-alpha-p2-s2 | Sonnet 4.5 | 2-2.5h | ~30K | ⬜ Not Started |
| 9 | v0.0.7-alpha-p2-s3 | Sonnet 4.5 | 2-2.5h | ~40K | ⬜ Not Started |

**Phase 2 Totals**: 6-7 hours, ~105K tokens

## Checkpoints

### After Phase 1 (Session 6)
- [ ] User review: Test simplified docs with beginner users
- [ ] Validate: Non-technical user reaches first lesson in <10 minutes
- [ ] Validate: Zero undefined jargon in user-facing docs
- [ ] Validate: All links pass `npx markdown-link-check`
- [ ] Decision: Continue to Phase 2 or iterate on Phase 1?

### After Phase 2 (Session 9)
- [ ] User review: End-to-end user journey testing (all 5 user types)
- [ ] Validate: Any doc reachable from README in <=3 clicks
- [ ] Validate: No duplicated installation instructions across docs
- [ ] Validate: All cross-references are bidirectional
- [ ] Decision: Deploy as-is or add hosting (MkDocs/Docusaurus)?

## Session Plan Files

Each session has a detailed plan file in `docs/plans/`:

1. `v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s1-fix-readme-setup.md`
2. `v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s2-command-tags-cheatsheet.md`
3. `v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s3-template-glossaries.md`
4. `v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s4-create-concepts.md`
5. `v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s5-create-command-guide.md`
6. `v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s6-simplify-workflows.md`
7. `v0.0.7-alpha-p2-s1-getting-started.md`
8. `v0.0.7-alpha-p2-s2-cross-references.md`
9. `v0.0.7-alpha-p2-s3-navigation-index.md`

## Git Workflow

**Base Branch**: `v0.0.7-alpha-gitbook-docs` (current)

**Branching Strategy** (see PARALLELIZATION-GUIDE.md for details):
```
v0.0.7-alpha-gitbook-docs (base)
├── v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s1 (session 1) → merge back
│
├── v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s2 (session 2) ─┐ ← can run in parallel
├── v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s3 (session 3) ─┘   after Session 1
│
├── v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s4 (session 4) ─┐ ← can run in parallel
├── v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s5 (session 5) ─┘   after Sessions 2+3
│
├── v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s6 (session 6) → merge back (needs 4+5)
│
│   === PHASE 1 CHECKPOINT ===
│
├── v0.0.7-alpha-p2-s1 (session 7) → merge back
├── v0.0.7-alpha-p2-s2 (session 8) → merge back
└── v0.0.7-alpha-p2-s3 (session 9) → merge back
```

**Merge Strategy**:
- Each session merges back to base after completion
- Next session branches from updated base
- All sessions stay in v0.0.7 family

## User Responsibilities

**During Implementation** (2-3 hours total):
- Review simplified language for technical accuracy
- Test key user journeys after Phase 1 checkpoint
- Provide feedback on glossary definitions
- Validate command difficulty classifications

**After Completion**:
- Test all 5 user journeys end-to-end
- Measure actual time-to-first-success with sample users
- Decide on hosting platform (none/MkDocs/Docusaurus)

---

## Notes

- **Model Selection**: Opus 4.6 used only for complex content creation (CONCEPTS, COMMAND-GUIDE)
- **Token Pacing**: 2-3 sessions per day max to avoid Pro plan limits
- **Reversibility**: All changes in git, can revert individual sessions if needed
- **Scope Protection**: No changes to commands, examples, or developer docs
