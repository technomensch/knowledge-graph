# v9.5.0 Phase 2: New Skills

**Session:** 2 — Claude Code
**Goal:** Write 8 new skills that don't have existing source to copy from.
**Deliverable:** All 16 skills functional in the plugin.
**Depends on:** Phase 1 (plugin structure + config schema must exist)
**Runs in parallel with:** Phase 3 (Antigravity) and optionally Phase 4
**Reference:** See `v9.5.0-master-plan.md` for full skill specifications, config schema, and wizard prompts.

## Pre-flight

- [ ] Phase 1 complete (all exit criteria met)
- [ ] Plugin loads: `claude --plugin-dir ./knowledge-graph-plugin`
- [ ] 8 ported skills working

## 2.1: Write 7 NEW skills from scratch

| Skill | File | Complexity | Notes |
|-------|------|-----------|-------|
| `/knowledge:init` | `skills/init/SKILL.md` | High | Wizard with 5 prompts, creates dirs + config. See master plan "Skills" section #1. |
| `/knowledge:list` | `skills/list/SKILL.md` | Low | Read `~/.claude/kg-config.json`, format output |
| `/knowledge:switch` | `skills/switch/SKILL.md` | Low | Update "active" field in config |
| `/knowledge:add-category` | `skills/add-category/SKILL.md` | Medium | Create dirs, update config, update .gitignore |
| `/knowledge:configure-sanitization` | `skills/configure-sanitization/SKILL.md` | Medium | Wizard, install pre-commit hook. See master plan "Skills" section #5. |
| `/knowledge:check-sensitive` | `skills/check-sensitive/SKILL.md` | Medium | Scan files with regex patterns, return report |
| `/knowledge:link-issue` | `skills/link-issue/SKILL.md` | Medium | Update YAML frontmatter + post GitHub comment. See master plan "Skills" section #7. |
| `/knowledge:status` | `skills/status/SKILL.md` | Low | Read config + count files + show quick reference. See master plan "Skills" section #16. |

**For each new skill:**
1. Create `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (name, description)
2. Include clear step-by-step instructions
3. Reference `~/.claude/kg-config.json` for active KG path
4. Handle edge cases (no config exists, no git repo, no gh CLI)
5. Include `// turbo` mode where applicable

## 2.2: Smoke test new skills

Quick verification that each skill loads and basic flow works:

- [ ] `/knowledge:init` — wizard prompts appear, creates dirs, writes config
- [ ] `/knowledge:list` — displays configured KGs from config
- [ ] `/knowledge:switch` — changes active KG, verify with list
- [ ] `/knowledge:add-category` — adds category to existing KG
- [ ] `/knowledge:configure-sanitization` — wizard runs, hook installed
- [ ] `/knowledge:check-sensitive` — scans KG files and reports findings
- [ ] `/knowledge:link-issue` — updates lesson frontmatter with issue reference
- [ ] `/knowledge:status` — shows active KG info and quick reference

---

## Exit Criteria

- [ ] All 16 skills appear in `/knowledge:` menu
- [ ] Each new skill completes its basic workflow without errors
- [ ] Config CRUD works: init → list → switch → add-category
- [ ] `/knowledge:status` shows correct stats and warnings for stale/missing config
- [ ] No hardcoded paths or project-specific references in new skills
