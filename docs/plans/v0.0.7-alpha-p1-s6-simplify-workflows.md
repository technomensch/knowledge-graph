## Session Goals

**Primary Objective**: Simplify WORKFLOWS.md for beginner-friendly language and clearer structure

**Content Reduction Strategy** (clarified):
The target of ~400-500 lines (down from 843) is achieved through THREE strategies, NOT by deleting content:
1. **Remove redundancy**: Eliminate content now covered by CONCEPTS.md (Session 4) and COMMAND-GUIDE.md (Session 5). Link to those docs instead of repeating definitions.
2. **Condense verbose sections**: Replace multi-paragraph explanations with concise bullet points + examples. Dense prose becomes scannable lists.
3. **Move reference material**: Relocate command-specific documentation to COMMAND-GUIDE.md (if not already there). WORKFLOWS.md focuses on *processes*, not *command details*.

**What We're Fixing**:
- Replace jargon with plain language (or link to CONCEPTS.md)
- Add inline explanations for complex concepts
- Break up dense paragraphs into scannable lists
- Add visual examples and diagrams
- Link to CONCEPTS.md for definitions instead of re-explaining inline

**Impact**: WORKFLOWS.md is critical for non-Claude users. Currently rated 4/10 clarity for non-technical users.

## Files to Modify

### Primary Files (Modify)
1. **core/docs/WORKFLOWS.md** (843 lines → ~400-500 lines)
   - Simplify language
   - Add inline explanations
   - Link to CONCEPTS.md
   - Add visual examples

### Files to Read First
- `core/docs/WORKFLOWS.md` (current version)
- `docs/CONCEPTS.md` (created in Session 4)
- Template files (to understand workflow)

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Branch
```bash
git checkout -b v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s6
```

### Step 2: Identify Jargon to Replace

**Scan for technical terms**:
```bash
grep -n "ISO 8601\|frontmatter\|scaffold\|sanitize\|git strategy\|namespace" core/docs/WORKFLOWS.md
```

**Jargon replacement map**:
- "ISO 8601" → "Date format (YYYY-MM-DD)" + link to CONCEPTS.md
- "YAML frontmatter" → "File metadata" + link to CONCEPTS.md
- "Git strategy" → "Save to git repository"
- "Namespace prefix" → "Category shorthand"
- "Sanitization" → "Removing sensitive data" + link to CONCEPTS.md
- "Token count" → "File size (for AI reading)"

### Step 3: Simplify Dense Sections

**Before** (lines 34-76, Manual Setup):
```markdown
### 2. Copy Templates

```bash
# Copy all templates to your project
cp -r core/templates/. docs/templates/

# Templates now available at:
# docs/templates/lessons-learned/lesson-template.md
# docs/templates/decisions/ADR-template.md
# etc.
```

[continues for 40+ lines with minimal explanation]
```

**After** (simplified):
```markdown
### 2. Set Up Templates

Templates are fill-in-the-blank forms for your knowledge. Copy them to your project:

```bash
# Copy all templates
cp -r core/templates/. docs/templates/
```

**What you get**:
- `lesson-template.md` - For documenting problems you solve
- `ADR-template.md` - For recording important decisions
- `entry-template.md` - For patterns and best practices
- `session-template.md` - For important work sessions

**Why templates?** They ensure consistency—every lesson has the same structure, making them easy to search and compare.

See [Templates Guide](CONCEPTS.md#template) for field explanations.
```

### Step 4: Add Visual Examples

Add before/after examples for complex workflows:

**Example: Capturing a Lesson**

```markdown
## Capturing Your First Lesson

### The Scenario

You spent 2 hours debugging a database connection issue. Here's how to document it:

**1. Copy the template**
```bash
cp docs/templates/lessons-learned/lesson-template.md \
   docs/lessons-learned/debugging/Database_Connection_Fix.md
```

**2. Fill in the fields**

Open the file and fill in [MANUAL] fields:

```yaml
---
title: "Lesson: Fixing PostgreSQL Connection Timeouts"  # [MANUAL]
category: debugging  # [MANUAL]
tags: [postgresql, database, timeout]  # [MANUAL]
# ... [AUTO] fields filled automatically if using commands
---
```

**3. Write what happened**

In the body, answer:
- What was the problem? ("Database connections timing out after 30 seconds")
- What caused it? ("Default timeout too low for our data volume")
- How did you fix it? ("Increased timeout to 60 seconds in config")
- How to prevent? ("Monitor query performance, add timeout alerts")

**4. Save and commit**

```bash
git add docs/lessons-learned/debugging/Database_Connection_Fix.md
git commit -m "docs: add lesson about PostgreSQL timeouts"
```

**Done!** Next time someone searches for "database timeout," they'll find your solution.
```

### Step 5: Break Up Long Workflows

**Current structure** (linear, overwhelming):
- Lines 59-450: One massive "Workflows" section

**New structure** (scannable, progressive):
1. **Quick Start** (First 5 minutes)
2. **Daily Workflows** (Regular use)
3. **Weekly Workflows** (Maintenance)
4. **Advanced Workflows** (Power users)

Each section: 50-100 lines max, with clear "When to use this" intro.

### Step 6: Add "Why This Matters" Callouts

Insert explanatory callouts for non-obvious steps:

```markdown
> **💡 Why git metadata?**
>
> Linking lessons to code changes lets you:
> - Jump from lesson → PR → actual code fix
> - See what code changed to solve the problem
> - Track which issues led to which learnings
>
> Without it, lessons are isolated notes. With it, they're living documentation.
```

### Step 7: Link to Other Guides

Add cross-references throughout:

```markdown
See [CONCEPTS.md](../../docs/CONCEPTS.md#yaml-frontmatter) for field explanations.

New to knowledge graphs? Start with [GETTING-STARTED.md](../../docs/GETTING-STARTED.md).

For writing great entries, see [PATTERNS-GUIDE.md](PATTERNS-GUIDE.md).
```

## Notes

**Simplification Strategy**:
- Don't delete valuable content — but DO eliminate redundancy with CONCEPTS.md and COMMAND-GUIDE.md
- Every jargon term → link to CONCEPTS.md (don't re-explain inline)
- Complex concept → break into steps with examples
- Long paragraph → bullet points or numbered lists
- Command-specific details → link to COMMAND-GUIDE.md

**User Testing After This Session**:
- Give non-technical user WORKFLOWS.md
- Task: "Follow the first workflow and create a lesson"
- Success: Complete in <10 minutes
- Failure: Identify where they got stuck, iterate

**Time Estimate Breakdown**:
- Read current WORKFLOWS.md: 20-30 min
- Identify jargon and complex sections: 15-20 min
- Simplify language section by section: 60-80 min
- Add visual examples: 20-30 min
- Update links and cross-references: 15-20 min
- Quality check: 10-15 min
- **Total**: 120-150 minutes (2-2.5 hours)
