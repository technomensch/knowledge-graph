# Session 4: Create CONCEPTS.md Glossary

**Branch**: `v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s4`
**Phase**: 1 (Critical UX Fixes)
**Session**: 4 of 9
**Model**: Opus 4.6 ⭐ (Complex Content Creation)
**Estimated Time**: 2-2.5 hours
**Estimated Tokens**: ~50K
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started
**Parallelizable**: ✅ Yes (with Session 5)

---

## Prerequisites

### Previous Sessions
- [ ] Sessions 1-3 (v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s1 through s3) completed and merged
- [ ] All changes pushed to remote

### Git State
- [ ] Currently on branch: `v0.0.7-alpha-gitbook-docs`
- [ ] Working directory is clean
- [ ] Latest changes pulled: `git pull origin v0.0.7-alpha-gitbook-docs`

### Verification Commands
```bash
git checkout v0.0.7-alpha-gitbook-docs
git pull origin v0.0.7-alpha-gitbook-docs
git status  # Should show clean working tree
git log --oneline -7  # Should see Sessions 1-3 commits
```

---

## Session Goals

**Primary Objective**: Create plain-English glossary of key concepts for non-technical users

**What We're Creating**:
- `docs/CONCEPTS.md` - Beginner-friendly explanations of technical terms
- Answers "What is a knowledge graph?" for first-time users
- Explains jargon used throughout documentation

**Impact**: Currently, 6+ critical terms are used without explanation. This will reduce onboarding confusion for non-technical users.

---

## Parallelization Strategy

**✅ CAN RUN IN PARALLEL** with Session 5 (Create COMMAND-GUIDE.md)

**Why**:
- Both sessions create NEW files (no conflicts)
- Different content domains (concepts vs commands)
- No dependencies between the two
- Can be done by different models/agents simultaneously

**Coordination**:
- If running in parallel, Session 4 should use Opus 4.6
- Session 5 can use Opus 4.6 or Sonnet 4.5
- Both merge independently to base branch

---

## Files to Modify

### Primary Files (Create)
1. **docs/CONCEPTS.md** (new file, ~300-400 lines)
   - "What is a knowledge graph?"
   - Term glossary (15-20 key terms)
   - Visual examples where helpful

### Files to Read First
- `/Users/mkaplan/Documents/GitHub/knowledge-graph/README.md`
- `/Users/mkaplan/Documents/GitHub/knowledge-graph/core/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `/Users/mkaplan/Documents/GitHub/knowledge-graph/core/docs/WORKFLOWS.md`
- Scan all docs for jargon that needs explanation

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Branch
```bash
git checkout -b v0.0.7-alpha-p1-s4
```

### Step 2: Identify Terms Needing Explanation

**Scan all user-facing docs for jargon**:
```bash
# Find technical terms used without definition
grep -r "knowledge graph\|YAML\|frontmatter\|git metadata\|ISO 8601\|MEMORY\.md\|sanitization\|meta-issue" \
  README.md docs/ core/docs/ | grep -v "^Binary"
```

**Key terms to define** (from UX analysis):
- [ ] Knowledge Graph
- [ ] YAML Frontmatter
- [ ] Git Metadata
- [ ] ISO 8601
- [ ] MEMORY.md
- [ ] Sanitization
- [ ] Meta-Issue
- [ ] MCP Server
- [ ] Namespace Prefix
- [ ] Token Count
- [ ] Template
- [ ] Category (architecture/process/patterns/debugging)
- [ ] ADR (Architecture Decision Record)
- [ ] Lesson Learned
- [ ] Session Summary

### Step 3: Create docs/CONCEPTS.md

**Structure**:
```markdown
# Knowledge Graph Concepts

**For beginners**: This guide explains key terms used throughout the documentation in plain English.

---

## What is a Knowledge Graph?

A **knowledge graph** is a structured way to organize what you learn while working on projects.

Think of it like a personal wiki that:
- **Captures lessons** as you solve problems
- **Documents decisions** and why you made them
- **Stores patterns** you discover
- **Tracks complex issues** across multiple attempts

Unlike a simple notes file, a knowledge graph:
- ✅ Uses consistent structure (templates)
- ✅ Links related information together
- ✅ Enables fast searching across all your learnings
- ✅ Syncs key insights to your AI assistant's memory

**Example**: You spend 2 hours debugging a database connection issue. Instead of losing that knowledge, you capture it as a "lesson learned." Next time you (or a teammate) encounter something similar, you search your knowledge graph and find the solution in 30 seconds.

---

## Core Components

### The Four Pillars

Your knowledge graph has 4 types of documents:

1. **Lessons Learned** (`/lessons-learned/`)
   - Problems you solved and how you solved them
   - Example: "Debugging PostgreSQL Connection Timeouts"

2. **Decisions** (`/decisions/`)
   - Important choices and their rationale
   - Example: "ADR-001: Why We Chose React Over Vue"

3. **Knowledge Entries** (`/knowledge/`)
   - Patterns, gotchas, architecture notes
   - Example: "API Rate Limiting Patterns"

4. **Session Summaries** (`/sessions/`)
   - What happened in important work sessions
   - Example: "2024-01-15 Database Migration Session"

---

## Key Terms

### YAML Frontmatter

**What it is**: Metadata at the top of each file, surrounded by `---` marks

**Example**:
```yaml
---
title: "My Lesson"
created: 2024-01-15T14:30:00Z
tags: [database, debugging]
---
```

**Why it exists**:
- Enables searching by date, author, category
- Allows automation to read file metadata
- Keeps info organized and consistent

**Plain English**: Think of it like the header on a form—it tells you who wrote it, when, and what category it belongs to.

---

### Git Metadata

**What it is**: Information about the code changes related to this lesson

**Fields**:
- `git.branch` - Which git branch you were on
- `git.commit` - The commit that fixed the problem
- `git.pr` - Pull request number (if applicable)
- `git.issue` - GitHub issue number (if tracked)

**Why it exists**: Links your learnings back to actual code changes

**Example**: You document a lesson about fixing a bug. Git metadata records which PR fixed it, so you can review the code later.

**Plain English**: A breadcrumb trail back to the actual code.

---

### ISO 8601

**What it is**: Standard date/time format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`

**Example**: `2024-01-15T14:30:00Z` = January 15, 2024 at 2:30 PM UTC

**Why this format**:
- Sorts correctly (2024-01-15 comes before 2024-02-01)
- No ambiguity (is 01/02/2024 Jan 2 or Feb 1?)
- Works internationally

**How to fill it**:
- For dates only: `2024-01-15`
- For date + time: `2024-01-15T14:30:00Z`
- The `T` separates date from time
- The `Z` means UTC timezone

**Plain English**: Year-Month-Day format that computers love.

---

### MEMORY.md

**What it is**: A special file that syncs your most important learnings to Claude's persistent memory

**Location**: `/MEMORY.md` in your knowledge graph

**How it works**:
1. You capture lessons and patterns
2. The `/knowledge:update-graph` command extracts key patterns
3. Top patterns are written to `MEMORY.md`
4. Claude reads `MEMORY.md` at the start of each session
5. Claude "remembers" your patterns automatically

**Why it exists**:
- Claude's context resets between sessions
- MEMORY.md persists your learnings across sessions
- You don't have to repeat yourself

**Example**: You teach Claude your team's git workflow once. It gets added to MEMORY.md. Every future session, Claude already knows your workflow.

**Plain English**: Claude's long-term memory file.

---

### Sanitization

**What it is**: Removing sensitive information before sharing code or docs publicly

**What gets removed**:
- API keys, passwords, tokens
- Email addresses, names
- Internal URLs, server addresses
- Private company information

**Why it matters**: Prevents accidentally sharing secrets on GitHub or in public docs

**How to do it**:
1. Run `/knowledge:check-sensitive` to scan
2. Review findings
3. Remove or redact sensitive data
4. Set up pre-commit hooks to catch it automatically

**Plain English**: Cleaning up secrets before sharing.

---

### Meta-Issue

**What it is**: A structured way to track complex problems that take multiple attempts to solve

**When to use**:
- Problem isn't solved after 2-3 attempts
- Root cause keeps evolving
- Need to track "what we tried" across weeks

**Structure**:
- `/meta-issues/problem-name/` folder
- `description.md` - What's the problem?
- `attempts/001-approach/` - First attempt
- `attempts/002-approach/` - Second attempt
- `test-cases.md` - How to verify it's fixed
- `timeline.md` - Chronology of events

**Example**: Performance degrades over 3 weeks. You try caching (didn't work), query optimization (helped but not enough), connection pooling (fixed it). Meta-issue tracks all 3 attempts and learnings.

**Plain English**: A detective's case file for hard bugs.

---

### Template

**What it is**: A pre-formatted file you copy to start a new lesson/decision/entry

**Location**: `core/templates/`

**How to use** (Manual workflow):
```bash
# Copy template
cp core/templates/lessons-learned/lesson-template.md \
   docs/lessons-learned/My_Lesson.md

# Fill in [MANUAL] fields
vim docs/lessons-learned/My_Lesson.md

# Save and commit
git add docs/lessons-learned/My_Lesson.md
git commit -m "docs: add lesson about X"
```

**How to use** (Claude Code workflow):
```bash
# Command auto-fills template for you
/knowledge:capture-lesson
```

**Plain English**: A fill-in-the-blank form for your learnings.

---

### Category

**What it is**: Grouping for lessons into 4 types

**Types**:
1. **architecture** - System design, component structure
   - Example: "Microservices vs Monolith Decision"

2. **process** - Workflow improvements, tools, procedures
   - Example: "Setting Up Pre-Commit Hooks"

3. **patterns** - Reusable design patterns, best practices
   - Example: "Retry Pattern for API Calls"

4. **debugging** - Troubleshooting, bug fixes, investigations
   - Example: "Solving Memory Leak in Node.js"

**Why categories**: Helps you find related learnings quickly

**Plain English**: Filing cabinet labels for your lessons.

---

## Workflows Explained

### Manual Workflow (Non-Claude Users)

**Steps**:
1. Copy template from `core/templates/`
2. Fill in `[MANUAL]` fields
3. Write your lesson content
4. Save file to appropriate directory
5. Commit to git

**Who uses this**: Cursor, Continue, Aider, or no AI assistant

---

### Automated Workflow (Claude Code Users)

**Steps**:
1. Run `/knowledge:capture-lesson`
2. Claude asks questions, fills template automatically
3. You review and approve
4. File saved and committed

**Who uses this**: Claude Code plugin users

---

## Common Questions

### "Do I need to know git to use this?"

**Short answer**: Basic git helps, but not required for Claude Code users.

**Long answer**:
- Claude Code handles git automatically
- Manual users need: `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`
- Git metadata is auto-detected (branch, commit, etc.)

### "What's the difference between a lesson and a decision?"

**Lesson**: How you solved a problem (tactical)
- "I debugged X by doing Y"
- "The error was caused by Z"

**Decision**: Why you made an architectural choice (strategic)
- "We chose database X because of reasons A, B, C"
- "We decided NOT to use framework Y because..."

### "Can I use this without Claude Code?"

**Yes!** The core system (`core/` directory) works with:
- Manual workflows (copy templates, edit by hand)
- Any AI assistant (Cursor, Continue, Aider)
- Python scripts included for standalone use

### "How is this different from regular notes?"

| Feature | Regular Notes | Knowledge Graph |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Structure | Freeform | Templated |
| Searchable | Maybe | Yes (by date, tag, category) |
| Git-linked | Rarely | Automatic |
| AI memory | No | Yes (MEMORY.md) |
| Team sharing | Hard | Easy (sanitization built-in) |
