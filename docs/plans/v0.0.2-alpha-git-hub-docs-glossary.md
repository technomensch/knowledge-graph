# Plan: Add Glossary Page to GitHub Docs (mkdocs-glossary-plugin)

**Target Release:** v0.0.2-alpha  
**Status:** Draft  
**Branch:** `v0.0.2-alpha-git-hub-docs-glossary` (already created from main)  
**Created:** 2026-03-01

---

## Context

The `docs/CONCEPTS.md` file already defines 18 key terms under the `## Key Terms` section. Currently, those terms are only reachable by navigating to the full Concepts page. This plan extracts them into a dedicated, standalone `docs/GLOSSARY.md` file and wires up `mkdocs-glossary-plugin` so terms auto-link throughout the documentation site.

---

## Proposed Changes

### File 1: `docs/GLOSSARY.md` [NEW]

Create a dedicated glossary page by copying the **`## Key Terms` section verbatim from `docs/CONCEPTS.md`** — no summarization, no content changes. The only modification is heading level: each term heading changes from `##` (H2, which is what CONCEPTS.md uses inside the section) to `### ` (H3) so `mkdocs-glossary-plugin` recognizes each block as a distinct glossary entry.

> **Content preservation rule**: Every sub-section must be copied exactly as-is — including **What it is**, **Why it matters**, **Example**, **Link notation used**, **Plain English**, **When to write one**, **Format**, **Fields captured**, tables, code blocks, and any other existing structure. Do not rephrase, shorten, or omit any content.

**Terms to copy (all 21, from `docs/CONCEPTS.md § Key Terms`):**

- Active Knowledge Graph (Active KG)
- ADR (Architecture Decision Record)
- Bidirectional Links
- Category
- Cross-References
- Git Metadata
- GitHub Issue
- ISO 8601
- Lesson Learned
- MCP Server
- MEMORY.md
- Meta-Issue
- Namespace Prefix
- Platform-Agnostic Core
- Pre-Commit Hook
- Sanitization
- Session Summary
- Sync Pipeline
- Template
- Token Count
- YAML Frontmatter

**Heading transformation (the only change allowed):**
```markdown
# Before (in CONCEPTS.md)
### Active Knowledge Graph (Active KG)

# After (in GLOSSARY.md)
### Active Knowledge Graph (Active KG)
```
If any term heading is already H3 in CONCEPTS.md, keep it as H3. The plugin uses H3 as the term delimiter.

### File 2: `mkdocs.yml` [MODIFY]

1. **Add plugin** under the `plugins:` section:
   ```yaml
   - mkdocs-glossary-plugin:
       glossaries:
         - docs/GLOSSARY.md
   ```

2. **Add nav entry** under a logical location (after `Concepts:`):
   ```yaml
   - Glossary: GLOSSARY.md
   ```

---

### File 3: `requirements.txt` [MODIFY]

Add the plugin dependency:
```
mkdocs-glossary-plugin
```

> ⚠️ **Check version compatibility**: Run `pip show mkdocs-glossary-plugin` after install to confirm it's compatible with the currently pinned `mkdocs-material` version.

---

## Steps

- [x] 1. Create `docs/GLOSSARY.md` by copying the full `## Key Terms` section from `CONCEPTS.md` verbatim — all sub-sections, tables, code blocks, and content intact. Only adjust heading levels to `### Term` for plugin compatibility.
- [x] 2. Audit `docs/reference/ARCHITECTURE.md` for each of the 21 key terms:
      - Search for any code block (` ``` ` fenced block) or inline example directly associated with the term
      - If found: append it **exactly as-is** to the matching `### Term` entry in `GLOSSARY.md`, under a `**Example:**` label if not already labelled
      - If nothing found for a term: no action needed for that term
- [x] 3. Add `mkdocs-glossary-plugin` to `requirements.txt`
- [x] 4. Install the plugin: `pip install mkdocs-glossary-plugin` (inside `.venv` if active)
- [x] 5. Add plugin config to `mkdocs.yml` → `plugins:` block, pointing to `docs/GLOSSARY.md`
- [x] 6. Add `Glossary: GLOSSARY.md` to `mkdocs.yml` → `nav:` (after `Concepts`)
- [x] 7. Run `mkdocs serve` locally and verify:
      - Glossary page renders correctly
      - Terms auto-link in at least 2 other pages (e.g., `CONCEPTS.md`, `GETTING-STARTED.md`)
      - No broken links in the nav
- [x] 8. **Only if Step 7 passes** (GLOSSARY.md verbatim-copy criterion verified): Remove the `## Key Terms` section and all 21 term entries from `docs/CONCEPTS.md`. Replace the section with a short forward reference, e.g.:
      ```markdown
      ## Key Terms

      Full definitions for all key terms have moved to the [Glossary](GLOSSARY.md).
      ```
- [x] 9. Re-run `mkdocs serve` and confirm `CONCEPTS.md` renders correctly with the forward reference
- [x] 10. **Only if Step 9 passes**: Remove any code blocks or examples that were copied from `docs/reference/ARCHITECTURE.md` in Step 2. Replace each removed block with a short forward reference, e.g.:
      ```markdown
      > See the [Glossary](../GLOSSARY.md#term-name) for a full definition and examples.
      ```
- [x] 11. Re-run `mkdocs serve` and confirm `ARCHITECTURE.md` renders correctly with the forward references
- [x] 12. Commit: `feat(docs): add glossary page with mkdocs-glossary-plugin Closes #<issue>`
- [x] 13. Push branch and open PR to main

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `docs/GLOSSARY.md` exists with all 21 terms as `### Term` headings, with full content copied verbatim from `CONCEPTS.md` (no summarization)
- [x] `mkdocs-glossary-plugin` is listed in `requirements.txt`
- [x] Plugin is configured in `mkdocs.yml` pointing to `docs/GLOSSARY.md`
- [x] `Glossary` appears in the site nav
- [x] `mkdocs build` completes with no errors
- [x] Terms auto-link correctly in the rendered site
- [x] `## Key Terms` body removed from `CONCEPTS.md` and replaced with a forward reference to `GLOSSARY.md` (only after verbatim-copy criterion above is met)
- [x] Any code blocks/examples copied from `ARCHITECTURE.md` into `GLOSSARY.md` are present verbatim; source blocks replaced with forward references in `ARCHITECTURE.md` (only after Step 10 passes)

## Definition of Done

- [x] All Steps checked
- [x] All Acceptance Criteria verified
- [x] Branch pushed, PR merged to main
