# v0.0.2-alpha: Plugin Validation and Knowledge Graph Usage Skill

**Version:** 0.0.2-alpha
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Branch:** v0.0.2-alpha
**Status:** Planning

---

## Context

### Problem Statement

During development of v0.0.1-alpha, there was concern that Opus may have incorrectly classified components as "skills" when they should have been "commands." The user requested a thorough audit using the plugin-dev creation workflow to:

1. Validate the current commands vs skills classification
2. Determine if restructuring is needed
3. Add any missing skill opportunities
4. Ensure plugin follows Claude Code best practices

### Analysis Findings

**Commands vs Skills Classification: ✅ CORRECT**

The current structure is properly organized:

| Component Type | Count | Status | Rationale |
|----------------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Commands | 17 | ✅ Correct | User-initiated, deterministic workflows, use tools |
| Skills | 0 | ⚠️ Opportunity | Could add autonomous guidance skill |
| Agents | 1 | ✅ Correct | knowledge-reviewer agent |
| Hooks | 1 | ✅ Correct | hooks.json |
| MCP Server | 1 | ✅ Correct | 7 tools, 2 resources |

**Why Commands are Correct:**
- All 17 components require explicit user invocation (`/knowledge:command-name`)
- Execute deterministic, step-by-step workflows
- Need tool access (Bash, Read, Write, etc.)
- Produce immediate, actionable results

**Skills would be different:**
- Autonomously activated by Claude (not user-initiated)
- Provide guidance/knowledge (not execute actions)
- Read-only (cannot use tools)
- Context-dependent loading

**Historical Context:**
- Opus originally created skill-style subdirectories with SKILL.md files
- These were correctly migrated to flat command .md files
- Evidence in `commands/old-folders/` (now cleaned up)
- Latest changes: Command files renamed with `knowledge-` prefix (e.g., `knowledge-status.md`)
- Command frontmatter simplified (removed deprecated `name:` field)

### Skill Opportunity Identified

While all current components are correctly commands, there IS value in adding ONE skill:

**knowledge-graph-usage** — Autonomous guidance for knowledge capture

**Purpose:** Provide proactive suggestions about when/how to use the knowledge graph system

**When it would trigger:**
- User solving recurring problems ("this happened again")
- Valuable insights emerging ("I finally figured it out")
- Architectural decisions being made
- End of work sessions
- Complex troubleshooting worth documenting

**Value proposition:**
- Reduces friction in knowledge capture (Claude suggests when appropriate)
- Improves documentation quality (guides what to include)
- Increases adoption (reminds users of available commands)
- Educates new users (explains knowledge graph concepts)

### Current State

**Branch:** v0.0.2-alpha
**Latest commit:** 3cbb8d5 "refactor(commands): remove deprecated name frontmatter from command docs"

**Files:**
- ✅ `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — Exists, properly formatted
- ✅ `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — Complete with metadata
- ✅ `commands/` — 17 command files with `knowledge-` prefix
- ⚠️ `skills/knowledge-graph-usage/` — Directory exists but empty (needs SKILL.md + references)
- ✅ `agents/knowledge-reviewer.md` — Exists
- ✅ `hooks/hooks.json` — Exists
- ✅ `.mcp.json` — MCP server configuration
- ✅ `README.md` — Updated for v0.0.1-alpha
- ✅ `ROADMAP.md` — Updated for v0.0.1-alpha completion

### Namespace Visibility Issue (Critical)

**Problem Discovered by Gemini:**

When plugins are installed via local marketplace (Distribution Mode), Claude Code automatically hides the namespace prefix if command names are unique—a feature called "Namespace Elision." This causes `/knowledge:status` to appear as just `/status`, compromising branding and categorization.

**Current Workaround Applied:**
- All command files manually renamed with `knowledge-` prefix (e.g., `knowledge-status.md`)
- Command frontmatter `name:` field removed (was deprecated)

**Permanent Solution Needed:**
Implement "Shadow Command" strategy to force namespace visibility:

1. **Add collision tool to MCP server** (`mcp-server/src/index.ts`):
   ```typescript
   server.tool(
     "list",  // Collides with core /list command
     "Internal trigger to force namespacing. Do not use.",
     {},
     async () => ({
       content: [{ type: "text", text: "Use /knowledge:kg_config_list instead." }]
     })
   );
   ```

2. **Update plugin.json** with UI metadata:
   ```json
   "ui": { "forceNamespace": true }
   ```

**Result:** All commands will consistently show `/knowledge:` prefix in autocomplete and UI.

**Documentation:** Lesson learned captured in `docs/plans/RECOVERED_Lessons_Learned_Plugin_Namespace_Visibility.md`

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 0A: Fix Marketplace Branding

**Goal:** Update marketplace.json to show "(tm-sis)" instead of "(knowledge)" in marketplace listings

**Problem:**
- Current marketplace listing shows "(knowledge)" as identifier
- User wants consistent publisher branding: "(tm-sis)" for "technomensch-stayinginsync"
- This allows multiple plugins under same publisher identity

**Investigation Needed:**
- Determine which field controls marketplace display identifier
- Likely candidates:
  - `marketplace.name` field
  - `owner.name` field
  - Plugin-level branding field

**Files to Modify:**

1. **`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`**

   Update marketplace name and/or owner fields:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "tm-sis",  // or "technomensch-stayinginsync"?
     "description": "technomensch's StayingInSync plugin marketplace",
     "owner": {
       "name": "technomensch-stayinginsync",  // or keep "technomensch"?
       "url": "https://github.com/technomensch",
       "email": "technomensch@stayinginsync.info"
     },
     "plugins": [
       {
         "name": "knowledge",
         ...
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **`README.md`**

   Add marketplace branding information:

   ```markdown
   ## Marketplace

   **Publisher:** tm-sis (technomensch-stayinginsync)
   **Plugin Name:** knowledge

   All plugins from this publisher are prefixed with "(tm-sis)" in the marketplace.
   ```

**Expected Result:**
- Marketplace listings show "(tm-sis)" consistently
- Publisher identity separate from individual plugin names
- Allows multiple plugins under same publisher brand

**Testing:**
```bash
# After changes, test marketplace display
# Verify identifier shows as "(tm-sis)" not "(knowledge)"
```

### Phase 0B: Re-initialize Knowledge Graph for Plugin Project

**Goal:** Set up knowledge graph for the knowledge-graph-plugin project itself (dogfooding)

**Actions:**

1. **Initialize KG:**
   ```bash
   /knowledge:init
   ```

   **Configuration:**
   - Name: `knowledge-plugin-dev`
   - Type: `project-local`
   - Location: `./docs/knowledge/`
   - Categories:
     - architecture
     - debugging
     - patterns
     - decisions
   - Git strategy: All categories committed

2. **Migrate Existing Lesson:**

   Move `docs/plans/RECOVERED_Lessons_Learned_Plugin_Namespace_Visibility.md` to the new KG:

   ```bash
   # Extract content
   # Reformat if needed for KG structure
   # Save to docs/knowledge/lessons-learned/
   # Name: Lessons_Learned_Plugin_Namespace_Visibility.md
   ```

3. **Verify Setup:**
   ```bash
   /knowledge:status
   # Should show: knowledge-plugin-dev KG active
   # Categories: architecture, debugging, patterns, decisions
   # Lessons: 1 (namespace visibility lesson)
   ```

**Rationale:** The plugin should use itself for documentation—demonstrates functionality and validates the workflow works correctly.

### Phase 1: Skip Shadow Command Strategy (Document Failure)

**Status:** ⚠️ SKIPPING THIS PHASE

**Reason:** The shadow command strategy was attempted but **failed when working with Gemini**. The user reverted to v0.0.1 and instead chose the simpler solution of renaming command files with the `knowledge-` prefix.

**Current Workaround (Already Applied):**
- ✅ All command files renamed: `knowledge-status.md`, `knowledge-init.md`, etc.
- ✅ Command frontmatter `name:` field removed (deprecated)
- ✅ This ensures consistent namespace visibility without MCP server modifications

**Why Shadow Command Failed:**
- Caused issues when plugin used with Gemini
- Exact error unknown but significant enough to warrant revert
- File prefix approach is simpler and more reliable

**Lesson to Capture:**
When documenting the namespace visibility lesson in the KG, include:
- ✅ Shadow command approach (attempted)
- ✅ Why it failed (Gemini compatibility issues)
- ✅ File prefix workaround (successful alternative)
- ✅ Trade-offs between approaches

**Decision:** Proceed with current file-naming approach. Shadow command strategy remains an option for future investigation but is not required for v0.0.2-alpha.

### Phase 2: Create Knowledge Graph Usage Skill

**Goal:** Add skill for autonomous knowledge graph guidance

**Files to Create:**

1. **`skills/knowledge-graph-usage/SKILL.md`** (~2,000 words)

   **Frontmatter (YAML):**
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: Knowledge Graph Usage
   description: This skill should be used when the user mentions "documenting lessons", "capturing knowledge", "remembering this for later", "we solved this before", "institutional memory", "project memory", or when Claude detects recurring problems, repeated patterns, or valuable insights worth preserving. Provides guidance on using the knowledge graph system effectively.
   version: 1.0.0
   ---
   ```

   **Body Content** (imperative form):
   - Purpose and overview
   - When to suggest knowledge capture (recurring problems, insights, decisions)
   - Available knowledge graph commands (reference all 17 commands)
   - Guidance principles (context-aware, explain value, respect workflow)
   - Usage patterns (reactive documentation, proactive recognition, decision docs, session wrap-up)
   - Integration with commands (capture → sync → recall flows)
   - Best practices for suggestions
   - Quick reference table

2. **`skills/knowledge-graph-usage/references/capture-patterns.md`** (~3,500 words)

   **Content:**
   - Problem-solution patterns (recurring bug, non-obvious workaround, multi-step diagnosis)
   - Architectural decision patterns (library selection, architecture refactor, tech stack)
   - Pattern recognition patterns (emerging anti-pattern, performance discovery)
   - Meta-issue patterns (multi-session investigation, system interaction bug)
   - Session summary patterns (sprint retrospective, daily wrap-up)
   - Command workflow patterns (capture → sync → recall, meta-issue → lesson → link)
   - Anti-patterns to avoid (over-documentation, under-documentation, late/vague docs)
   - Quality checklist for good lessons

3. **`skills/knowledge-graph-usage/references/command-workflows.md`** (~4,000 words)

   **Content:**
   - Core command reference table
   - 10 detailed workflow patterns:
     1. First-time setup
     2. Daily development
     3. Complex investigation
     4. Knowledge sync
     5. Knowledge search
     6. Sprint retrospective
     7. Pre-publication check
     8. Multi-KG management
     9. GitHub integration
     10. Onboarding new team member
   - Command combinations
   - Timing recommendations
   - Advanced workflows (knowledge garden maintenance, pattern mining, migration)

4. **`skills/knowledge-graph-usage/examples/` directory** (optional)
   - Could add example trigger scenarios
   - Good lesson examples
   - Bad lesson examples for contrast

**Writing Guidelines:**
- ✅ Third-person description in frontmatter ("This skill should be used when...")
- ✅ Specific trigger phrases in description
- ✅ Imperative/infinitive form in body (not second person)
- ✅ Lean SKILL.md (~2,000 words) with detailed content in references/
- ✅ Reference supporting files clearly
- ✅ Progressive disclosure (core in SKILL.md, details in references/)

### Phase 3: Capture Namespace Lesson in New KG

**Goal:** Document the namespace visibility issue and solution in the knowledge graph

**Actions:**

1. **Use the Plugin on Itself:**
   ```bash
   /knowledge:capture-lesson
   ```

   **Content to capture:**
   - Topic: "Plugin Namespace Visibility & Shadow Commands"
   - Problem: Namespace Elision in Distribution Mode
   - Root cause: Claude Code registry hides prefix for unique commands
   - Solution: Shadow command strategy
   - Implementation: MCP server collision + UI metadata
   - Prevention: Always include shadow command for consistent namespacing
   - Source: docs/plans/RECOVERED_Lessons_Learned_Plugin_Namespace_Visibility.md

2. **Sync to Knowledge Graph:**
   ```bash
   /knowledge:sync-all
   ```

   Extracts KG entries, updates MEMORY.md

3. **Verify:**
   ```bash
   /knowledge:status
   # Should show: Lessons: 1

   /knowledge:recall "namespace"
   # Should find: Plugin Namespace Visibility lesson
   ```

**Rationale:** Demonstrates the plugin working on itself, validates the capture workflow, and preserves this critical architecture decision.

### Phase 4: Run Plugin Validator

**Goal:** Comprehensive validation of entire plugin structure

**Agent:** `plugin-validator` from plugin-dev toolkit

**Validation Focus:**
1. **Plugin Structure**
   - Manifest completeness (.claude-plugin/plugin.json)
   - Marketplace configuration (marketplace.json)
   - Directory organization
   - Auto-discovery conventions

2. **Components**
   - All 17 commands (frontmatter, description, structure)
   - New skill (description quality, progressive disclosure, writing style)
   - Agent configuration
   - Hooks configuration
   - MCP server setup

3. **Naming Conventions**
   - File naming (kebab-case, correct extensions)
   - Command naming with `knowledge-` prefix
   - Skill directory naming

4. **Security**
   - No hardcoded credentials
   - No sensitive data in files
   - Proper use of ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
   - Safe command execution

5. **Best Practices**
   - Commands follow command development patterns
   - Skill follows skill development patterns
   - Agent follows agent development patterns
   - Documentation completeness

**Expected Output:**
- Summary of findings
- Critical issues (must fix)
- Warnings (should fix)
- Recommendations (nice to have)
- Overall quality assessment

### Phase 5: Fix Critical Issues

**Goal:** Address any critical issues found by validation

**Process:**
1. Review validation report
2. Categorize issues by severity
3. Fix critical issues first (blocking problems)
4. Address warnings as time permits
5. Document any deferred improvements

**Common Issues to Watch For:**
- Incomplete frontmatter
- Missing descriptions or unclear trigger phrases
- Second-person language in skill body
- Unreferenced supporting files
- Security concerns
- Missing documentation

### Phase 6: Testing and Verification

**Goal:** Verify plugin works correctly

**Test Plan:**

1. **Skill Triggering Test**
   ```
   Test query: "I keep solving this same authentication bug. It happened twice this week."
   Expected: knowledge-graph-usage skill should load
   Verify: Skill provides relevant guidance about using /knowledge:capture-lesson
   ```

2. **Command Execution Test**
   ```bash
   /knowledge:status     # Should display KG status
   /knowledge:list       # Should list available KGs
   ```

3. **MCP Server Test**
   ```bash
   # Run test script from tests/ directory
   ./tests/test-mcp-direct.sh

   # Verify 7 tools available:
   # - kg_config_init, kg_config_list, kg_config_switch
   # - kg_config_add_category, kg_search, kg_scaffold
   # - kg_check_sensitive
   ```

4. **Plugin Loading Test**
   ```bash
   # Restart Claude Code with plugin
   claude --plugin-dir /path/to/knowledge-graph-plugin

   # Verify:
   # - Plugin loads without errors
   # - Commands appear in /help
   # - Skill is available (trigger test)
   # - MCP server starts
   ```

### Phase 7: Documentation Updates

**Goal:** Ensure documentation reflects new skill

**Files to Update:**

1. **`README.md`**
   - Update component count (Skills: 1 instead of 0)
   - Add skill description in features section
   - Reference skill in quick start if appropriate

2. **`CHANGELOG.md`**
   - Add v0.0.2-alpha entry
   - Document new skill
   - Note validation improvements
   - List any fixes made

3. **`ROADMAP.md`**
   - Mark v0.0.2-alpha as complete
   - Note skill addition
   - Update completion dates

### Phase 8: Commit and Push

**Goal:** Save changes to repository

**Commit Strategy:**

```bash
# Stage skill files
git add skills/knowledge-graph-usage/

# Stage any fixes
git add [fixed files]

# Stage documentation
git add README.md CHANGELOG.md ROADMAP.md

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add knowledge-graph-usage skill and initialize plugin KG

Phase 0: Initialize Knowledge Graph
- Initialize knowledge-plugin-dev KG at docs/knowledge/
- Capture namespace visibility lesson (shadow command failure)
- Document file prefix workaround as successful alternative

Phase 1: Shadow Command Strategy
- Skipped - Failed with Gemini, reverted to file prefix approach
- Current workaround: commands renamed with knowledge- prefix

Phase 2: Add Knowledge Graph Usage Skill
- SKILL.md with third-person description and trigger phrases
- references/capture-patterns.md with detailed patterns (3,500 words)
- references/command-workflows.md with workflow guides (4,000 words)
- Provides autonomous guidance on knowledge capture opportunities

Phase 3-5: Validation and Fixes
- Run plugin-validator for comprehensive structure check
- Fix [list critical issues fixed]
- All 17 commands validated as correctly classified

Phase 6-7: Documentation
- Update README, CHANGELOG, ROADMAP for v0.0.2-alpha
- Document namespace lesson learned and workaround

The skill provides proactive guidance on when and how to use the
knowledge graph system, detecting opportunities for knowledge capture
and suggesting appropriate commands.

## Notes

### Lessons from Previous Attempts

1. **Opus's Mistake:** Created skills when they should be commands
   - **Why it happened:** Misunderstood autonomous vs user-initiated distinction
   - **How we fixed it:** Migrated to flat command files
   - **Validation:** All 17 components verified as correctly commands

2. **Command Naming Evolution:**
   - **v0.0.1-alpha:** Files like `status.md` with `name:` in frontmatter
   - **v0.0.2-alpha:** Files like `knowledge-status.md`, no `name:` in frontmatter
   - **Reasoning:** Simplified structure, clearer namespace

3. **Namespace Visibility Issue (Gemini + Shadow Command Failure):**
   - **Problem:** Claude Code's Namespace Elision hides `/knowledge:` prefix
   - **Attempted Solution:** Shadow command strategy (add collision tool)
   - **Result:** FAILED when working with Gemini
   - **Fallback:** Rename files with `knowledge-` prefix
   - **Lesson:** File prefix is simpler, more reliable, and cross-LLM compatible
   - **Status:** Shadow command approach abandoned for v0.0.2-alpha

4. **Skill Opportunity:**
   - **Insight:** While commands are correct, a skill adds value
   - **Key difference:** Skill is guidance-only, doesn't execute actions
   - **Purpose:** Proactive suggestions, not replacement for commands

### Future Improvements (Post-v0.0.2)

- **Skill Enhancement:** Add examples directory with sample lessons
- **Testing:** Create automated test suite for skill triggering
- **Documentation:** Video tutorial showing skill in action
- **Metrics:** Track skill trigger frequency and user feedback
- **Iteration:** Refine trigger phrases based on real usage
