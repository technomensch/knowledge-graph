# v0.0.1-github-docs: Homepage Restructure

**Target Release:** v0.0.1-github-docs
**Status:** In Progress
**Branch:** `v0.0.1-github-docs`

---

## Context

Alpha testers reported the homepage doesn't clearly answer three questions: what the project is, why it should matter to them, and how to use it. The current page leads with a self-deprecating "personal learning project" info box, followed immediately by a warning admonition — two signals that discourage engagement before the value proposition appears. The content itself is strong; the ordering is wrong, and audience/use-case context is missing entirely.

**Goal:** Restructure `docs/index.md` for a value-first layout that adds audience identification and concrete use cases. Existing language is preserved (with explicitly noted edits where needed). No other files change.

---

## Decision: Pure Markdown Only (no HTML overrides)

Material for MkDocs has a `home.html` override template for hero sections, but it adds complexity (new directory, Jinja2 inheritance, mkdocs.yml structural change) not justified here. The issue is **information architecture**, not visual styling. The existing CSS and grid card system already produce a polished result.

**Files changed:** `docs/index.md` only
**No changes to:** `mkdocs.yml`, `extra.css`, any other doc

---

## New Page Structure (8 blocks)

### Block 1 — H1 + Value Proposition + Audience
Open with the payoff immediately. No preamble, no admonitions first. Includes audience identification (missing from current page — flagged in Opus review).

```markdown
# Knowledge Management Graph

**Structured knowledge capture, lesson-learned documentation, and cross-session memory for AI-assisted development.**

Built for developers and teams using AI coding assistants — Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Continue.dev, and others — who need to retain what they learn across sessions, projects, and platforms.
```

**Source notes:**
- Bold tagline: adapted from current line 9 (broadened from "Claude Code projects" to "AI-assisted development" to match platform-agnostic positioning)
- Audience sentence: **new copy** — addresses the missing "who is this for?" feedback directly

---

### Block 2 — Why It Matters (3-card grid)
Problem/Solution/Outcome triad. Uses existing language as card body text where possible.

```markdown
## Why It Matters

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-chat-question: **The Problem**

  Development knowledge lives in chat threads that disappear. Every LLM switch, session restart, or team handoff loses context — architecture decisions, debugging solutions, recurring patterns, and process learnings are lost permanently.

- :material-lightbulb-on: **The Solution**

  This plugin helps users capture the important stuff — lessons learned, architecture decisions, recurring patterns — inside the development workflow without having to stop chatting.

- :material-database-check: **The Outcome**

  Users can easily look up that information not only in their current chat, but also in any other chat session, even if they switch to a totally different LLM!

</div>
```

**Source notes:**
- Card 1 (Problem): **new framing** — synthesizes the implicit problem into an explicit statement. Incorporates specifics from README line 18 ("architecture decisions, debugging solutions, recurring patterns") to ground the abstract.
- Card 2 (Solution): **adapted** from current line 15. Changed "The cool thing is, it helps users grab" to "This plugin helps users capture" for professional register in a card labeled "The Solution." Adds the README parenthetical specifics.
- Card 3 (Outcome): **verbatim** from current line 27 (including "!" preserved).
- Icons: `:material-chat-question:`, `:material-lightbulb-on:`, `:material-database-check:` — all in the [Material Design Icons set](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/). Changed `:material-brain:` to `:material-lightbulb-on:` (confirmed available; brain icon requires verification).

---

### Block 3 — Concrete Use Cases (Mermaid Journey Flow)
**Replaced bulleted list** with a Mermaid `graph LR` journey flow diagram showing three phases: trigger moments → capture → future payoff.

**Trigger moments (6):** Debugging breakthrough, Architecture decision, Recurring pattern discovered, End of a work session, Multi-release problem solved, Tricky setup figured out.

**Payoff moments (4):** Switch tools without losing context, Onboard teammates from real experience, Search past solutions in seconds, Review sprint lessons at the retrospective.

Additional changes to this section:
- Removed emdashes from original bullet copy, replaced with colons and commas.
- Added agile sprint retrospectives as a use-case (moved to payoff column in diagram).
- Added intro sentence: "Knowledge capture fits naturally into everyday development."

**Source notes:** Trigger scenarios derived from project features (lesson capture, session summaries, meta-issue tracking, pattern extraction). Payoff scenarios map to cross-session recall, team sharing, and sprint review workflows.

---

### Block 4 — Quick Start (existing 4-card grid)
Existing 4-card grid. Verbatim copy-paste except: removed "Start here:" intro text (made sense when this was the first content block; reads oddly as block 4 of 8).

```markdown
## Quick Start

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- **[Getting Started](GETTING-STARTED.md)**

  Install, initialize, and configure in under 5 minutes. Step-by-step setup for installing with Claude Code, Cursor, or any local IDE CLI coding assistant

- **[Concepts](CONCEPTS.md)**

  Understand the knowledge graph structure. Learn about the Four Pillars this project was built on, key terminology, and how everything connects.

- **[Command Guide](COMMAND-GUIDE.md)**

  Full reference for all commands, organized by learning path. Essential, intermediate, and advanced commands.

- **[Cheat Sheet](CHEAT-SHEET.md)**

  One-page quick reference with the most common commands and workflows at a glance.

</div>
```

**Source notes:** Verbatim from current lines 37-55. Only change: "Start here:" (line 35) removed.

---

### Block 5 — How It Works (features)
Existing feature bullets. Moved AFTER Quick Start so interested visitors hit the actionable cards first, then get details.

**Changes made:**
- Rewrote opening paragraph for concreteness: "Knowledge is stored as markdown files inside the project directory. There is no external database and no cloud dependency. Any tool that opens the project can read it."
- Changed `??? note` to `???+ note` (open by default) to improve feature discoverability on the homepage.

**Source notes:**
- Feature bullets: all 9 verbatim, unchanged
- Opening paragraph: rewritten for clarity (original was vague: "The key lies in the simple approach...")

---

### Block 6 — Installation (existing tier table)
Verbatim copy-paste. Zero changes.

```markdown
## Installation

The plugin supports three installation tiers:

| Tier | Platform | Commands Available |
|------|----------|--------------------|
| **Tier 1** | Claude Code (marketplace or local) | slash commands + hooks + agents |
| **Tier 2** | MCP IDEs (Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, JetBrains) | MCP tools |
| **Tier 3** | Any platform (template-only) | Manual markdown workflow |

See [Getting Started](GETTING-STARTED.md) for platform-specific setup instructions.
```

---

### Block 7 — Beta Feedback CTA (moved to bottom, reframed)

```markdown
!!! success "Help Shape the Beta Release"
    This project has **finished its initial alpha development** and is now actively seeking feedback from test users before launching the beta phase. If you're interested in helping shape the future of this plugin, please [open an issue](https://github.com/technomensch/knowledge-graph/issues) with your feedback, feature requests, or bug reports.
```

**Source notes:**
- Body text: verbatim from current `!!! warning` (lines 6-7)
- Change 1: `!!! warning` → `!!! success` (green = invitation, not orange = caution)
- Change 2: Title "Alpha Development Complete — Seeking Beta Testers" → "Help Shape the Beta Release"
- **Visual note:** `!!! success` is not in `extra.css` overrides — falls through to Material's built-in green. May differ slightly from the custom-styled admonitions (`note`, `tip`, `warning`, `info`). Verify visual consistency during `mkdocs serve` and add a `.admonition.success` rule to `extra.css` as a follow-up if needed.

---

### Block 8 — About This Project (collapsible, demoted)

```markdown
??? info "About This Project"
    This project was initially built as a **personal learning project** to explore **docs-as-code** practices and plugin development. It has evolved into a comprehensive knowledge management system designed for institutional knowledge capture and cross-session memory. The architecture reflects these principles: platform-agnostic core, automated workflows, and portable knowledge representation.

    This is a platform-agnostic knowledge graph that was developed entirely using Gemini and Claude, leveraging very specific context and detailed natural language prompting.
```

**Source notes:**
- First paragraph: verbatim from current `!!! info "📚 Project Origin"` (line 4)
- Second paragraph: verbatim from current line 11. Relocated here from the mid-page narrative to keep it as project backstory (it describes how the tool was built, not what it does for users)
- `???` syntax = collapsed by default. Renders as native `<details>`/`<summary>` — keyboard accessible, screen reader compatible.

---

### Block 9 — Links
Existing links section. Verbatim copy-paste. Zero changes.

```markdown
## Links

- **Repository:** [github.com/technomensch/knowledge-graph](https://github.com/technomensch/knowledge-graph)
- **Issues:** [github.com/technomensch/knowledge-graph/issues](https://github.com/technomensch/knowledge-graph/issues)
- **Releases:** [github.com/technomensch/knowledge-graph/releases](https://github.com/technomensch/knowledge-graph/releases)
```

---

### Block 10 — Dedicated Documentation Changelog [NEW]
**New file** — `docs/CHANGELOG-DOCS-ONLY.md`. Tracks documentation infrastructure and content changes separately from application releases.

**Source notes:**
- Documents homepage redesign (Mermaid journey flow, UX refinements).
- Documents GETTING-STARTED edits (Universal Installer clarifications).
- Fixes and accessibility audits.

## 508 Accessibility Checks
- [ ] `:material-*:` icons render with `aria-label` in built HTML — verify with browser inspector
- [ ] `??? info` and `??? note` blocks are keyboard-expandable (native `<details>`)
- [ ] `!!! success` title uses descriptive text
- [ ] Link text in Links section is descriptive
- [ ] Heading hierarchy: H1 → H2 throughout, no skipped levels

---

## Implementation Steps

- [ ] Create branch `v0.0.1-github-docs` from current HEAD
- [ ] Verify all three icon names exist at [pictogrammers.com/library/mdi](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/): `chat-question`, `lightbulb-on`, `database-check`
- [ ] Rewrite `docs/index.md` using the 9-block structure above
- [ ] Run `mkdocs build` — verify zero new warnings
- [ ] Run `mkdocs serve` locally — verify:
  - 3-card "Why It Matters" grid renders side-by-side on desktop
  - 3-card grid stacks correctly on mobile (single column, reading order: Problem → Solution → Outcome)
  - `??? info` and `??? note` blocks are **collapsed** by default
  - `!!! success` renders **green** and is visually consistent with other admonitions
  - Icons appear in the three cards (no raw `:material-*:` text)
- [ ] If `!!! success` clashes with dark mode palette, add `.admonition.success` rule to `extra.css`
- [ ] Commit: `docs(homepage): restructure index.md for value-first layout with audience and use cases`
- [ ] Push branch `v0.0.1-github-docs` to origin (DO NOT merge — await review)

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Homepage answers "what is this?" in the first 2 lines of visible text
- [ ] Homepage answers "who is this for?" with explicit audience identification
- [ ] Homepage answers "why should I care?" with Problem/Solution/Outcome cards
- [ ] Homepage answers "when would I use this?" with concrete use case scenarios
- [ ] Homepage answers "how do I start?" with Quick Start cards above the feature list
- [ ] All existing content is preserved (relocated or collapsed, not deleted)
- [ ] All 9 feature bullets present and unchanged
- [ ] Zero `mkdocs build` warnings
- [ ] Branch pushed to origin for review

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All implementation steps completed and verified
- [ ] Visual verification on desktop and mobile
- [ ] 508 accessibility checks passed
- [ ] Branch pushed to origin (awaits user review before merge)

---

## What This Does NOT Include

- HTML template overrides (`docs/overrides/`) — pure Markdown approach
- CSS changes — unless `!!! success` visual consistency requires it
- Changes to any other documentation page
- Version bumps to `package.json` or `README.md` — this is a docs-only change
