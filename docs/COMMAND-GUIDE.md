# Command Reference Guide

> **Claude Code only:** The `/kmgraph:` prefix requires Claude Code with this plugin installed. Other IDEs access equivalent functionality through MCP tools — see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for platform-specific setup.
## About Commands on Other Platforms

These commands are designed as reference documentation for any LLM:

- **Claude Code:** Invoke as slash commands (e.g., `/kmgraph:capture-lesson`)
- **Other platforms:** Copy the command prompt into your LLM. Substitute `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` with your actual project path
- **No-tool LLMs:** Commands serve as workflow documentation — follow steps manually

Commands work across platforms, but full automation is Claude Code-specific.

## Essential Commands

### 🟢 `/kmgraph:init`

**Purpose**: Initialize a new knowledge graph with wizard-based setup

**When to use**:
- First time setup on any project
- Starting a new project that needs its own knowledge graph
- Creating a separate KG for different work (e.g., personal vs. team)

**What it does**:
1. Asks for KG name and storage location (project-local, global, or custom path)
2. Prompts for category selection (architecture, process, patterns, debugging, or custom)
3. Asks for optional custom prefixes per category
4. Creates directory structure (`knowledge/`, `lessons-learned/`, `decisions/`, `sessions/`, `chat-history/`)
5. Copies templates from the plugin
6. **[NEW in v0.0.10.2]** Optionally backfills from existing project context (README, CHANGELOG, lessons, decisions, chat history)
7. Optionally installs a git post-commit hook for lesson capture suggestions
8. Updates `.gitignore` based on chosen git strategy
9. Registers the KG in `~/.claude/kg-config.json` and sets it as active

**Time**: 2-3 minutes

**Example**:
```bash
/kmgraph:init

# Claude asks:
# - What should this knowledge graph be called?
# - Where should it be stored? (project-local / global / custom)
# - Which categories do you want to include?
# - Would you like to backfill from existing project context? (y/N)
#   (If yes: scans README, CHANGELOG, lessons-learned/, decisions/, chat-history/)
# - Install post-commit hook? (y/n)
# - Git strategy for each category? (commit/ignore)
```

**Backfill Feature**:
When you enable backfill, the system extracts existing knowledge from your project:
- **README.md** — Project overview and key concepts
- **CHANGELOG.md** — Released features and changes
- **lessons-learned/** — Existing lessons (if any)
- **decisions/** — Architecture Decision Records
- **chat-history/** — Extracted chat logs

The system presents candidates for your review before creating entries.

**Next steps**: Run `/kmgraph:status` to verify setup

---

### 🟢 `/kmgraph:capture-lesson`

**Purpose**: Document lessons learned, problems solved, and patterns with git metadata tracking

**When to use**:
- Just solved a problem
- Discovered a reusable pattern
- Fixed a tricky bug worth remembering
- Learned something that future you will need

**What it does**:
1. Checks for duplicate/similar existing lessons (pre-flight search)
2. Asks verification questions (topic, audience, scope)
3. Auto-detects category from keywords (architecture, debugging, process, patterns)
4. Gathers git metadata (branch, commit hash, PR, issue number) from YAML frontmatter
5. Guides content gathering (problem, root cause, solution, prevention)
6. Writes the lesson file using the template from `core/templates/`
7. Updates category and chronological indexes
8. Optionally triggers `/kmgraph:update-graph` to extract KG entries
9. Optionally links to a GitHub Issue via `/kmgraph:link-issue`

**Time**: 5-10 minutes (faster with practice)

**Example**:
```bash
/kmgraph:capture-lesson

# Claude guides you through:
# 1. What problem did you encounter?
# 2. What was the root cause?
# 3. How did you solve it?
# 4. How can this be prevented?
```

**Tips**:
- Capture while the problem is fresh (don't wait)
- Include error messages verbatim
- Note what DIDN'T work (helps future you)

---

```

**Tip**: Supports `--minimal` for a one-line summary and `--json` for machine-readable output.

---

### 🟢 `/kmgraph:recall`

**Purpose**: Search across all project memory systems (lessons, decisions, knowledge graph, sessions)

**When to use**:
- "I solved this before..."
- Looking for a specific pattern or solution
- Need to find a past architectural decision
- Searching for context on a topic

**What it searches**:
- Lessons learned (full text)

**When to use**:
- After creating or updating lesson-learned documents
- When discovering new patterns or best practices
- Before completing complex work sessions
- Daily or weekly consolidation of captured knowledge

**What it does**:
1. Identifies new or modified lessons (since last sync or last 24 hours)
2. Reads each lesson and extracts: title, problem, solution, when-to-use triggers
3. Checks if a matching KG entry already exists in `knowledge/patterns.md` (or similar)
4. Creates new entries or updates existing ones with bidirectional links
5. Runs data integrity audit on each new entry
6. Checks MEMORY.md size and syncs new patterns if within token limits
7. Commits KG and MEMORY.md changes together

**Time**: 1-5 minutes depending on number of lessons

/kmgraph:update-graph --lesson=Pattern_Discovery.md    # Process specific lesson
/kmgraph:update-graph --auto                          # Skip prompts, silent mode
/kmgraph:update-graph --interactive                    # Review each entry before saving
```

**Tips**:
- `--auto` flag is useful when called from other commands (e.g., after `/kmgraph:capture-lesson`)
- `--interactive` flag lets you review and edit each extracted entry before saving

---

### 🟡 `/kmgraph:add-category`

**Purpose**: Add a new category to an existing knowledge graph with optional custom prefix

**When to use**:
- Need to track a new domain (e.g., security, ml-ops, devops)
- Team-specific categorization needed beyond defaults
- Organizing lessons into more granular groups

**What it does**:
1. Prompts for category name (or accepts from command argument)
2. Asks for optional prefix (e.g., "sec-" for security lessons)

4. Creates `lessons-learned/[category]/` directory
5. Creates `knowledge/[category].md` KG entry file from template
6. Updates `kg-config.json` with the new category
7. Updates `.gitignore` if git strategy is "ignore"

**Time**: Under 1 minute

**Example**:
```bash
/kmgraph:add-category
/kmgraph:add-category security

**When to use**:
- Before context limits are reached (~180K tokens)
- At major milestones during long sessions
- Before handing work to another developer
- End of a productive work session to preserve context

**What it does**:
1. Auto-detects session scope from conversation context since last summary
2. Classifies session type (feature development, debugging, planning, research)
3. Generates summary with: goals, problems solved, files touched, commits, lessons, next steps
4. Handles duplicate detection — offers to update existing or create new summary
5. Saves to `{active_kg_path}/sessions/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD_description.md`
6. Updates sessions README index
7. Optionally triggers lesson capture and KG update

**Time**: Under 10 seconds (analysis + write)

---

### 🟡 `/kmgraph:switch`

**Purpose**: Change the active knowledge graph for all subsequent commands

**When to use**:
- Switch between different project knowledge graphs
- Change to a topic-based KG for cross-project patterns
- Return to a previously used KG

**What it does**:

**What it does**:
1. Prompts for scan patterns (emails, API keys, personal names, internal URLs)
2. Collects custom regex patterns specific to your project
3. Asks for action on match (warn or block commit)
4. Installs a pre-commit hook script to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
5. Creates `.claude/sanitization-config.json` with selected configuration

**Time**: 2-3 minutes

**Example**:
```bash
/kmgraph:config-sanitization

# Wizard asks:
# 1. What should be scanned for? (checkboxes for email, API keys, names, URLs)
# 2. Any custom patterns? (e.g., "ACME Corp", "internal\.company\.com")
# 3. What should happen when found? (1. Warn  2. Block)
# → Installs hook and creates config
```

**Output**:
```
✅ Pre-commit sanitization hook installed!

Scan patterns: emails, API keys, custom patterns (2)
Action: Block commits with sensitive data

Test the hook:
  git add docs/knowledge/patterns.md
  git commit -m "test"
```

---

### 🟡 `/kmgraph:extract-chat`

**Purpose**: Extract chat history from Claude and Gemini local log sources

**When to use**:
- Preserve chat history for reference or knowledge extraction
- End of day archival of important conversations
- When logs might be cleared by app updates

**What it does**:
1. Determines output directory (active KG's `chat-history/` by default, or custom path)
2. Scans Claude logs (`~/.claude/projects/` for `.jsonl` files) and/or Gemini logs (`~/.gemini/tmp/`, `~/.gemini/antigravity/conversations/` for `.json`/`.pb` files)
3. Merges sessions by date into `YYYY-MM-DD-claude.md` and/or `YYYY-MM-DD-gemini.md`
4. Supports incremental append — re-running adds new sessions without overwriting

**Time**: Under 30 seconds

**Date filtering options**:
- `--today` — Extract only today's sessions
- `--date=YYYY-MM-DD` — Extract only sessions from a specific date
- `--after=YYYY-MM-DD` — Extract sessions from this date onwards (inclusive)
- `--before=YYYY-MM-DD` — Extract sessions up to and including this date
- `--project=<fragment>` — Filter to sessions from a specific project (path fragment match)

**Example**:
```bash
/kmgraph:extract-chat                                          # Extract all (Claude + Gemini)
/kmgraph:extract-chat -claude                                  # Extract only Claude
/kmgraph:extract-chat -gemini                                  # Extract only Gemini
/kmgraph:extract-chat --output-dir=/custom/path               # Custom output location
/kmgraph:extract-chat --today                                  # Today only
/kmgraph:extract-chat -claude 2026-02-20 through 2026-02-21   # Date range
/kmgraph:extract-chat --project=knowledge-graph               # Specific project only
```

**Tips**:
- Extracted files are automatically searchable via `/kmgraph:recall`
- Optional `blackboxprotobuf` Python library enables Gemini protobuf file support
- Date ranges use natural language: `YYYY-MM-DD through YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD`
- Gemini date filtering: passthrough implemented; underlying Gemini extraction may have known limitations

---

### 🟡 `/kmgraph:update-doc`

**Purpose**: Update an existing documentation file — plugin/project documentation (`--user-facing`) or knowledge graph content

**When to use**:
- A plugin feature changed and COMMAND-GUIDE, CHEAT-SHEET, or README needs updating
- Adding a new command entry to user-facing docs
- Ensuring documentation follows v0.0.7 language standards (third-person, Section 508)

**What it does**:

Without `--user-facing`: shows a disambiguation dialog to distinguish plugin documentation from KG content.

With `--user-facing`:
1. Reads target file and displays current sections and version
2. Asks what type of update (add command entry, update existing entry, add section, update metadata, validate only)
3. Runs v0.0.7 standards validation (third-person voice, heading hierarchy, table headers, link text)
4. Shows diff preview before writing
5. Applies changes and commits with standards-compliant message

**Time**: 2-5 minutes

**Example**:
```bash
/kmgraph:update-doc COMMAND-GUIDE.md --user-facing   # Update plugin documentation wizard
/kmgraph:update-doc README.md --user-facing           # Update README with new feature info
/kmgraph:update-doc some-lesson.md                    # Disambiguation dialog for KG content
```

**Tips**:
- Always use `--user-facing` for plugin/project docs (README, COMMAND-GUIDE, CHEAT-SHEET, etc.)
- Without `--user-facing`, a dialog clarifies whether the target is plugin docs or KG content
- Standards validation runs automatically — violations are flagged before writing

---

## Advanced Commands

### 🔴 `/kmgraph:meta-issue`

**Purpose**: Initialize and manage meta-issue tracking for complex multi-attempt problems

**When to use** (2 or more criteria should be met):
- 3+ solution attempts already tried or expected
- Root cause understanding has shifted 2+ times
- Problem spans multiple project versions
- High complexity requiring coordination across systems
- Significant learning value for future similar problems

**What it does**:
1. **Initialize** (`/kmgraph:meta-issue "Problem Title"`):
   - Prompts for domain, scope, severity, expected attempts
   - Creates structured directory under `{active_kg_path}/issues/[meta-issue-name]/`
   - Populates core files: README, description, implementation-log, test-cases
   - Creates analysis files: root-cause-evolution, timeline, lessons-learned
   - Links to knowledge graph
2. **Add attempt** (`--add-attempt 003 "Try connection pooling"`):
   - Creates numbered attempt folder with solution approach and results templates
   - Updates implementation log
3. **Update understanding** (`--update-understanding "Root cause is network latency"`):
   - Records belief shifts with timestamp and evidence
   - Updates description with current best understanding
4. **View status** (`--status`):
   - Shows all active meta-issues with attempt counts and current understanding

**Time**: 3-5 minutes for initialization

**Example**:
```bash
/kmgraph:meta-issue "Authentication Redesign"
/kmgraph:meta-issue --add-attempt 002 "OAuth2 with JWT"
/kmgraph:meta-issue --update-understanding "Token expiry logic flawed"
/kmgraph:meta-issue --status
```

> **Note**: Do NOT use meta-issue for simple bugs, standard features, or one-off debugging. Use `/kmgraph:capture-lesson` instead.

---

### 🔴 `/kmgraph:start-issue-tracking`

**Purpose**: Initialize issue tracking for a specific problem or enhancement with structured documentation and Git branch creation

**When to use**:
- Identified a bug that needs structured tracking
- Planning a new feature or enhancement
- Documenting a problem before solving it
- Creating a developer handoff with full context

> **Note**: The term "issue" here refers to a GitHub Issue — a platform feature for tracking bugs and feature requests/enhancements.

**What it does**:
1. Scans chat history for recent proposals ("Would you like me to...")
2. Runs git authority check and auto-detects version increment path
3. Auto-detects issue type from keywords (bug vs. enhancement)
4. Creates directory structure with documentation templates (description, solution approach, test cases, implementation log)
5. Generates an implementation plan with safety headers and atomic approval protocol
6. Creates a Git feature branch (`issue/{N}-{slug}`)
7. Optionally creates a draft PR on GitHub with `--body-file` populated from solution approach
8. Links to knowledge graph and prompts for lesson capture
9. Engages implementation freeze — stops before any code changes

**Time**: 5-10 minutes

**Example**:
```bash
/kmgraph:start-issue-tracking
/kmgraph:start-issue-tracking CLI flag parsing fails on quoted args
/kmgraph:start-issue-tracking Add token usage display
```

**Tips**:
- Uses the Dual-ID Policy: local IDs (`issue-N` or `ENH-NNN`) are independent from GitHub issue numbers (`#N`)
- Always use `--body-file` flag (not manual summary) when creating the GitHub Issue

---

### 🔴 `/kmgraph:update-issue-plan`

**Purpose**: Synchronize knowledge graph extraction with active plans and local/GitHub issue tracking

**When to use**:
- After extracting new KG entries with `/kmgraph:update-graph`
- When implementation plan needs to reflect new insights
- Before committing governance-related changes
- When progress needs to be posted to a GitHub Issue

> **Note**: References to "issues" here mean GitHub Issues — platform-level bug reports or feature requests.

**What it does**:
1. **Knowledge extraction**: Runs `/kmgraph:update-graph` to extract patterns
2. **Plan sync**: Updates the active implementation plan with a "Lessons Learned Integration" section
3. **Local issue update**: Appends progress and new verification requirements to local issue docs
4. **GitHub sync**: Maps local issue ID to GitHub Issue number, posts a knowledge sync comment, and updates PR description with related lessons
5. **Governance audit**: Outputs a summary table showing sync status across all components

**Time**: 2-5 minutes

**Example**:
```bash
/kmgraph:update-issue-plan
/kmgraph:update-issue-plan --auto       # Skip prompts
/kmgraph:update-issue-plan --pr=42      # Sync to specific PR
```

**Tips**:
- Works fully offline — GitHub steps gracefully degrade if `gh` CLI is not installed
- Decision gates will prompt before creating new issues for out-of-scope discoveries

---

### 🔴 `/kmgraph:link-issue`

**Purpose**: Manually link an existing lesson or ADR to a GitHub Issue with bidirectional references

**When to use**:
- A lesson was captured but not linked to its relevant GitHub Issue
- An ADR should reference the GitHub Issue that prompted the decision
- Building traceability between knowledge and tracked work

> **Note**: "Issue" here refers to a GitHub Issue — which could be a bug report or a feature request/enhancement.

**What it does**:
1. Validates the file exists and issue number is provided
2. Updates YAML frontmatter in the lesson/ADR with issue and PR metadata
3. Posts a comment to the GitHub Issue with a link to the lesson (if `gh` CLI available)
4. Updates the related KG entry with the issue reference
5. Reports bidirectional link status

**Time**: Under 1 minute

**Example**:
```bash
/kmgraph:link-issue docs/lessons-learned/process/my-lesson.md --issue 42
/kmgraph:link-issue docs/decisions/ADR-005.md --issue 38 --pr 40
```

---

### 🔴 `/kmgraph:archive-memory`

**Purpose**: Archive stale MEMORY.md entries to prevent bloat while preserving historical context

**When to use**:
- MEMORY.md approaching 1,500 token soft limit (warning from `/kmgraph:sync-all`)
- MEMORY.md exceeds 2,000 token hard limit (blocked from adding new entries)
- Periodic cleanup (recommended quarterly)
- Before major project phase changes

**What it does**:
1. Calculates current MEMORY.md token count (word count × 1.3)
2. Identifies stale entries using date-based staleness criteria (default: 90 days)
3. Previews entries proposed for archival with token savings estimate
4. Moves stale entries to `MEMORY-archive.md` (preserving content)
5. Adds archive notice and log to both files
6. Commits both files with descriptive message

**Time**: 1-2 minutes

**Example**:
```bash
/kmgraph:archive-memory
/kmgraph:archive-memory --auto           # Skip confirmation
/kmgraph:archive-memory --dry-run        # Preview without writing
/kmgraph:archive-memory --threshold=180  # Custom staleness threshold (days)
```

**Tips**:
- Token limits: 1,500 soft (warning) / 2,000 hard (block)
- Archived entries can be restored with `/kmgraph:restore-memory`

---

### 🔴 `/kmgraph:restore-memory`

**Purpose**: Restore archived MEMORY.md entries from MEMORY-archive.md back into active memory

**When to use**:
- Need to reference archived knowledge for current work
- Working on a problem related to a previously archived solution
- Rebuilding context from a previous project phase
- Token budget has been freed up and historical context is needed

**What it does**:
1. Parses all archived entries with IDs, titles, dates, and token sizes
2. Supports fuzzy search by title, ID-based selection, or interactive list
3. Previews entry content and calculates post-restoration token count
4. Checks token limits before restoring (blocks if would exceed 2,000 token hard limit)
5. Inserts entry into the appropriate MEMORY.md section
6. Updates archive log with restoration timestamp (entry content remains in archive for history)
7. Commits both files

**Time**: 1-2 minutes

**Example**:
```bash
/kmgraph:restore-memory                    # Interactive mode (show list, select)
/kmgraph:restore-memory "Git Pre-Commit"  # Fuzzy search by title
/kmgraph:restore-memory --id=5            # Restore by archive ID
/kmgraph:restore-memory --list            # Show all archived entries
/kmgraph:restore-memory --dry-run         # Preview without writing
```

---

### 🔴 `/kmgraph:sync-all`

**Purpose**: Automated knowledge sync orchestrator — replaces 4-step manual pipeline with 1 command

**When to use**:
- After significant work sessions to consolidate everything
- Weekly deep sync to ensure KG, MEMORY.md, plans, and GitHub are aligned
- Before major milestones or project phase changes
- As a catch-up sync if you've been capturing lessons without syncing

**What it does**:
1. **Scans** for new or modified lessons in `{active_kg_path}/lessons-learned/`
2. **Extracts** KG entries from lessons (delegates to `/kmgraph:update-graph`)
3. **Checks** MEMORY.md size and syncs new patterns (respects token limits)
4. **Links** to active implementation plan if relevant
5. **Updates** local issue with KG references and progress notes
6. **Enriches** today's session summary with KG insights
7. **Generates** GitHub Issue comment draft and asks for single confirmation before posting

**Time**: 1-5 minutes depending on volume

**Example**:
```bash
/kmgraph:sync-all
/kmgraph:sync-all --auto       # Skip GitHub posting confirmation
/kmgraph:sync-all --dry-run    # Preview without changes
```

**Output**:
```
Knowledge Sync Complete
-----------------------
Lessons scanned:  3 (2 new, 1 modified)
KG entries:       2 created, 1 updated
MEMORY.md:        Updated (1 new pattern)
Plan linked:      v2.0 (Step 2 → Prefix Naming lesson)
Local issue:      issue-42 (updated)
GitHub:           #45 (comment posted)
Session:          2026-02-11 (enriched)
```

**Tips**:
- Idempotent — safe to run multiple times (existing entries updated, not duplicated)
- GitHub integration is optional — works fully offline if `gh` CLI is not installed

---

### 🔴 `/kmgraph:handoff`

**Purpose**: Create comprehensive project handoff documentation for transitions, context limits, or onboarding

**When to use**:
- Before transitioning project to another developer
- Preparing for context window limits (>180K tokens)
- Completing a major release cycle
- Creating documentation for AI assistant handoffs
- Before taking a long break

**What it creates**:
1. **START-HERE.md** — Current session state, active branch, next steps
2. **DOCUMENTATION-MAP.md** — File inventory with purpose annotations
3. **SESSION-COMPILATION.md** — Recent session summaries linked chronologically
4. **OPEN-ISSUES.md** — Unresolved issues, PRs, and pending work
5. **ARCHITECTURE-SNAPSHOT.md** — Current codebase structure and key decisions

**Time**: 2-5 minutes depending on project size

**Example**:
```bash
/kmgraph:handoff
/kmgraph:handoff --output-dir=./backup/
/kmgraph:handoff --skip-sessions     # Faster, smaller output
```

**Output**:
```
✅ Handoff package created!

Location: ./handoff-packages/2026-02-27

Files:
- START-HERE.md               — 85 lines
- DOCUMENTATION-MAP.md        — 156 lines
- SESSION-COMPILATION.md      — 234 lines
- OPEN-ISSUES.md              — 67 lines
- ARCHITECTURE-SNAPSHOT.md    — 189 lines

Total: ~731 lines of documentation
Reading time: ~30-45 minutes for complete orientation
```

**Tips**:
- Creates dated directory: `handoff-packages/YYYY-MM-DD/` by default
- Files can be shared via zip or archived for future reference
- Perfect companion to `/kmgraph:session-summary` for comprehensive handoff

---

### Issue Tracking: meta-issue vs start-issue-tracking

**Two levels of issue tracking**:

1. **`/kmgraph:start-issue-tracking`**
   - For individual bugs or enhancements
   - Creates a single issue directory, implementation plan, and Git branch
   - Standard workflow for most tracked work

2. **`/kmgraph:meta-issue`**
   - For complex problems requiring 3+ solution attempts
   - Creates a richer directory structure with attempt folders and root-cause evolution
   - Tracks how understanding changes over time

**When to use which**:
- Standard bug or feature → `start-issue-tracking`
- Multi-attempt investigation → `meta-issue`

---

### Memory: archive vs restore

**MEMORY.md lifecycle management**:

1. **`/kmgraph:archive-memory`**
   - Moves stale entries (>90 days old by default) to `MEMORY-archive.md`
   - Frees token budget for new entries
   - Recommended when approaching 1,500 token soft limit

2. **`/kmgraph:restore-memory`**
   - Brings archived entries back to active MEMORY.md
   - Fuzzy search or ID-based selection
   - Checks token limits before restoring

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found"

**Problem**: Claude doesn't recognize `/kmgraph:...` command

**Solutions**:
1. Verify plugin installed: Check Claude Code > Extensions
2. Restart Claude Code
3. Update plugin: Check for updates in marketplace
4. Check active KG: Run `/kmgraph:status`

---

### "No active knowledge graph"

**Problem**: Commands fail with "no active KG"

**Solutions**:
1. Run `/kmgraph:init` to create your first KG
2. Run `/kmgraph:list` to see available KGs
3. Run `/kmgraph:switch` to activate an existing KG

---

### "MEMORY.md is too large"

**Problem**: MEMORY.md over 1,500 tokens, slowing down sessions or blocking new entries

**Solutions**:
1. Run `/kmgraph:archive-memory` to archive old entries
2. Review archived entries: Check `MEMORY-archive.md`
3. Restore if needed: `/kmgraph:restore-memory`
4. Adjust threshold: `/kmgraph:archive-memory --threshold=60` for more aggressive archival

---

### "No chat history found"

**Problem**: `/kmgraph:extract-chat` finds no logs

**Solutions**:
1. Verify log directories exist:
   ```bash
   ls ~/.claude/projects/
   ls ~/.gemini/tmp/
   ```
2. Check if you've used Claude Code or Gemini recently
3. Logs may be cleared on app updates

---

### "Protobuf extraction fails"

**Problem**: Gemini `.pb` files can't be read

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Install optional dependency
pip install blackboxprotobuf

# Or skip protobuf files (JSON extraction still works)
/kmgraph:extract-chat -gemini  # Will warn about .pb files
```

---

### "Git branch creation fails"

**Problem**: `/kmgraph:start-issue-tracking` can't create a branch

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# Make sure you're on main/develop
git checkout main

# Try again
git checkout -b issue/N-description
```
