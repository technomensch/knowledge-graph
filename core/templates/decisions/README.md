## ADR Statuses

- **Proposed:** Decision under consideration
- **Accepted:** Decision approved and implemented
- **Deprecated:** No longer relevant or superseded
- **Superseded:** Replaced by a newer ADR

## Creating a New ADR

1. **Determine next number:** Find the highest existing ADR number and increment
2. **Copy template:** Use [ADR-template.md](ADR-template.md)
3. **Fill all sections:** Context, Decision, Rationale, Consequences
4. **Link to evidence:** Reference lessons learned, KG entries, implementation
5. **Update this index:** Add entry above

---

## Integration

- **Knowledge Graph:** Architecture ADRs link to architecture.md entries
- **Lessons Learned:** Decisions often emerge from lessons
- **Meta-Issues:** Complex decisions may reference meta-issue investigations

---

## Format

ADRs follow a lightweight format:
- Sequential numbering (001, 002, ...)
- Descriptive filename with slug
- Standard sections: Context, Decision, Rationale, Consequences, Related
- Status tracking (Proposed → Accepted → Deprecated/Superseded)
