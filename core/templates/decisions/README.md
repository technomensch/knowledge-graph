## ADR Statuses

- **Proposed:** Decision under consideration
- **Accepted:** Decision approved and implemented
- **Deprecated:** No longer relevant or superseded
- **Superseded:** Replaced by a newer ADR

---

## Field Guide

The ADR template uses manual markdown fields (no auto-fill commands yet):

**Header Fields (all manual):**
- `ADR-XXX` - Sequential number (e.g., ADR-001, ADR-002)
- `Title` - Concise decision description
- `Date` - Date decision was made (format: 2024-01-15)
- `Status` - Current status (Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded)
- `Implements` - Optional: Version or feature this applies to
- `Related` - Optional: Links to related ADRs, lessons, KG entries

**Content Sections:**
All sections are manually filled:
- **Context** - Why this decision is needed
- **Decision** - What was decided (clear, concise statement)
- **Rationale** - Why this choice over alternatives
- **Consequences** - Positive and negative impacts
- **Related** - Links to implementation, lessons, KG entries

**Troubleshooting:**
- ADRs are created manually — no auto-fill commands yet
- Replace all `[bracketed placeholders]` with your content
- For sequential numbering, check the highest existing ADR number and add 1

**Examples:**
See [core/examples/decisions/](../../examples/decisions/) for filled-out ADR examples.

## Creating a New ADR

1. **Determine next number:** Find the highest existing ADR number and increment
2. **Copy template:** Use [ADR-template.md](ADR-template.md)
3. **Fill all sections:** Context, Decision, Rationale, Consequences
4. **Link to evidence:** Reference lessons learned, KG entries, implementation
5. **Update this index:** Add entry above

---

## Integration

- **Knowledge Graph:** Architecture ADRs link to architecture.md entries
- **Lessons Learned:** Decisions often emerge from lessons
- **Meta-Issues:** Complex decisions may reference meta-issue investigations

---

## Format

ADRs follow a lightweight format:
- Sequential numbering (001, 002, ...)
- Descriptive filename with slug
- Standard sections: Context, Decision, Rationale, Consequences, Related
- Status tracking (Proposed → Accepted → Deprecated/Superseded)
