## Usage

**To add a new lesson:**
Use `/knowledge:capture-lesson` which automatically:
1. Creates the lesson file with template structure
2. Auto-detects category based on topic
3. Captures git metadata (branch, commit, PR, issue)
4. Updates this index
5. Links to knowledge graph

**To search lessons:**
Use `/knowledge:recall "query"` to search across all lessons.

## Integration

- **Knowledge Graph:** Lessons feed patterns, gotchas, concepts to KG
- **ADRs:** Architecture lessons often lead to architecture decision records
- **MEMORY.md:** Critical patterns from lessons sync to persistent memory
- **Meta-Issues:** Complex problems reference multiple lessons
