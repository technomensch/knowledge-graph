# /kmgraph:handoff

Create a comprehensive handoff package for project transitions, context limit preparation, or new developer onboarding.

---

## Description

This command generates a complete handoff package consolidating all work, issues, and progress into structured documentation for AI assistants or new developers.

**Package Contents:**
- **START-HERE.md** — Current session state, active branch, what's in progress
- **DOCUMENTATION-MAP.md** — File inventory with purpose annotations
- **SESSION-COMPILATION.md** — Recent session summaries linked chronologically
- **OPEN-ISSUES.md** — Unresolved issues, open PRs, pending reviews
- **ARCHITECTURE-SNAPSHOT.md** — Current codebase structure and key decisions (from ADRs)

**Purpose:** Enable seamless knowledge transfer and preparation for context window limits.

**When to use:**
- Before transitioning to another developer
- Preparing for context limit (>180K tokens)
- Completing a major release cycle
- Creating documentation for AI assistant handoffs
- Before taking a long break

---

## Usage

```bash
/kmgraph:handoff
/kmgraph:handoff --output-dir=<custom-path>
/kmgraph:handoff --skip-sessions
```

**Parameters:**
- `--output-dir=<path>` (optional): Custom output directory (default: `./handoff-packages/YYYY-MM-DD/`)
- `--skip-sessions` (optional): Exclude session compilation (faster, smaller output)
- `--force` (optional): Overwrite existing handoff package for today

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Determine Output Directory

**If --output-dir not provided:**
```bash
output_dir="./handoff-packages/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
mkdir -p "$output_dir"
```

**If --output-dir provided:**
```bash
output_dir="<user-provided-path>"
mkdir -p "$output_dir"
```

**Announce to user:**
```
Handoff package will be created in: $output_dir
```

---

### Step 2: Generate START-HERE.md

**Collect current state:**
```bash
# Get active branch
current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
current_commit=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)

# Get last 3 commits
recent_commits=$(git log --oneline -3)

# Get file count changes
files_changed=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD | wc -l)

# Check for uncommitted changes
git status --porcelain
```

**Create START-HERE.md:**

```markdown
# Start Here — Project Handoff

**Last Updated:** [timestamp]
**Created for branch:** $current_branch

---

## Current State

**Active Branch:** $current_branch
**Current Commit:** $current_commit

ls -1 commands/*.md | xargs wc -l | sort -rn

# Document skills/
ls -1 skills/*/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null | while read f; do basename $(dirname $f); done

# Document agents/
ls -1 agents/*.md

# Document hooks (from hooks.json)
jq '.hooks[] | .trigger' hooks/hooks.json 2>/dev/null

# Document decisions
ls -1 decisions/ADR-*.md | wc -l

# Document lessons
find lessons-learned -name "*.md" -type f | wc -l
```

**Create DOCUMENTATION-MAP.md:**

```markdown
# Documentation Map

**Last Updated:** [timestamp]

## Code Protection Rules

⚠️ These directories require explicit user permission before modification:

- **commands/** — LLM execution prompts; changes break slash command functionality
- **core/templates/** — Structured formats with YAML frontmatter for parsing

Allowed modifications without permission:
- Documentation files (*.md)
- Test files (tests/, test-*.js)
- Examples and guides
- Template comments and field glossaries

---

## Version Consistency

**Current versions:**
- package.json: v[version]
- plugin.json: v[version]
- mcp-server/package.json: v[mcp-version]
- README.md: v[version]

**Note:** mcp-server is versioned independently. Verify alignment before releasing.
```

---

### Step 4: Generate SESSION-COMPILATION.md

**Collect recent sessions:**
```bash
# Find docs/sessions/ directory
session_dir="docs/sessions"

# List last 5 session files by date
ls -1tr $session_dir/*/*.md 2>/dev/null | tail -5
```

**Create SESSION-COMPILATION.md:**

```markdown
# Session Compilation

**Compilation Date:** [timestamp]
**Branch:** [current-branch]

---

## Summary

Last 5 sessions and key decisions:

[For each session file, extract:]
- Date and title
- Type (Feature, Bug Fix, Refactoring, Planning, Documentation)
- Key commits created (hash + message)
- Decisions made
- Lessons learned
- Next steps

---

[Include chronologically ordered summaries from last 5 sessions]

---

## Patterns Discovered Across Sessions

[Scan recent sessions for recurring patterns, decisions, or learnings]
```

---

### Step 5: Generate OPEN-ISSUES.md

**Scan for open issues:**
```bash
# GitHub issues (if available)
gh issue list --state open --json title,body,number 2>/dev/null

# Open pull requests
gh pr list --state open --json title,headRefName,number 2>/dev/null

# Check docs/plans/ for active plans
ls docs/plans/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -3

# Check for TODO comments
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|XXX\|HACK" commands/ skills/ agents/ 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

**Create OPEN-ISSUES.md:**

```markdown
# Open Issues & Pending Work

**Last Updated:** [timestamp]

## Architectural Principles

1. **Modular KG system** — Multi-KG support with active/inactive switching
2. **Layered documentation** — Commands (CLI), Skills (context), Agents (heavy-lift)
3. **Approval gates** — Subagents wait for user approval before writes
4. **Git-aware** — Preserves commit metadata, branch context, issue links
5. **Privacy-first** — Sessions and chat history never committed to repo

---

## Key Decisions (from ADRs)

[List all ADRs with decision and rationale]

---

## Code Protection Rules

**🔒 PROTECTED DIRECTORIES** (require explicit permission):
- **commands/** — Contains LLM execution prompts; changes break slash commands
- **core/templates/** — Structured YAML formats; changes break parsing

**✅ Allowed Modifications** (no permission needed):
- Documentation files (*.md)
- Test files and examples
- Template comments and field glossaries

---

## Naming Conventions

### Branch Names
- Feature: `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}-{description}` (e.g., v0.0.10.1-alpha-skills)
- Bug fix: `v{major}.{minor}.{patch}.{subpatch}-fix-{description}` (e.g., v0.0.8.7.3-alpha-fix-installer)
- Docs-only: `v{major}.{minor}-docs-update-{description}` (e.g., v0.0.9-docs-update-command-guide)

### Commit Format
```
type(scope): subject

[bullet summary of changes]

Closes #[issue-number]

Co-Authored-By: Claude [Model] <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

Types: `feat` | `fix` | `docs` | `refactor` | `chore` | `perf` | `style` | `test` | `build` | `ci` | `revert`

### Skills & Agents
- Skills: Lowercase, kebab-case (e.g., lesson-capture, kg-recall)
- Agents: CamelCase (e.g., KnowledgeExtractor, SessionDocumenter)

---

## Version Strategy

**Current Version:** v[version]-alpha

**Versioning:**
- Major.minor.patch.subpatch format
- Alpha releases during development (v0.0.x-alpha)
- Version consistency required across: package.json, plugin.json, README.md, mcp-server/package.json
- MCP server versioned independently (may not match plugin version)

## Recent Architecture Changes

[List 3-5 most recent ADRs and their status]
```

### Step 7: Verify Output

**Confirm all files created:**
```bash
ls -lh "$output_dir"/*.md
wc -l "$output_dir"/*.md | tail -1
```

**Announce completion:**
```
✅ Handoff package created!

Location: $output_dir

Files:
- START-HERE.md                    — [X] lines
- DOCUMENTATION-MAP.md             — [X] lines
- SESSION-COMPILATION.md           — [X] lines
- OPEN-ISSUES.md                   — [X] lines
- ARCHITECTURE-SNAPSHOT.md         — [X] lines

Total: ~[XX] lines of documentation

Reading time: ~30-45 minutes for complete orientation
Quick reference: ~15 minutes (START-HERE + DOCUMENTATION-MAP)

Next steps:
1. Review START-HERE.md for current context
2. Skim DOCUMENTATION-MAP.md for file locations
3. Read SESSION-COMPILATION.md for recent decisions
4. Check OPEN-ISSUES.md for blockers

Handoff ready for sharing or archival!
```
